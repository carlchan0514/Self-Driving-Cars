00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:25,310
Welcome to the final module of the first course in our self-driving cars specialization.

2
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,150
In this module, you'll get the chance to bring together and apply

3
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,090
the concepts we've discussed throughout this course and test them in simulation.

4
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,825
We'll start by discussing various self-driving car simulation environments.

5
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,120
Then I'll show you the simulator that you'll

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,540
use in this course and throughout this specialization.

7
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,330
A realistic simulation environment is

8
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,570
an essential tool for developing a self-driving car,

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,090
because it allows us to ensure that our vehicle will

10
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,025
operate safely before we even step foot in it.

11
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:00,010
Using a simulator, we can test all of

12
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,730
the different modules that make up our system including perception,

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,645
planning, and control, either together or independently.

14
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:13,600
We can run sophisticated scenarios involving many AI controlled vehicles and pedestrians,

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,030
and we can run variations on these scenarios,

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,730
hundreds or even thousands of times to

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,105
ensure our car consistently makes the correct decision.

18
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,180
Most importantly, we can test our car in

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,725
situations that would be too dangerous for us to test on actual roads.

20
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:32,830
There are a wide range of simulators available,

21
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,175
developed by teams from industry and academia alike.

22
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:39,910
For this course, we'll be using the simulator called Carla.

23
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,400
Carla is a simulator developed by a team with members from

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,020
the Computer Vision Center at the Autonomous University of Barcelona,

25
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,275
Intel and the Toyota Research Institute and built using the Unreal game engine.

26
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:58,039
It features highly detailed virtual worlds with roadways,

27
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,880
buildings, weather, and vehicle and pedestrian agents.

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,800
Images of these environments can be captured in various formats including

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,650
depth maps and segmented images which

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,220
you'll learn more about in the third course of this specialization.

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,010
The entire simulation can be controlled with

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,360
an external client which can be used to send commands to the vehicle,

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,060
record data and automatically execute

34
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,285
scenarios for evaluating the performance of your car.

35
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:29,210
Best of all, Carla is open source.

36
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,270
So, anyone is free to modify any aspect of

37
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,620
the code in order to meet their particular simulation requirements.

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,760
For this specialization, we've developed a customized version of

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,220
Carla with some extra tools to help you implement and test your code and simulation.

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,810
Let's take a look at how you might interact with and use the simulator.

41
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,880
Don't worry about the following along.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
There's a detailed guide about how to set up Carla and

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,465
run the Python clients in the assessment instructions.

44
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:02,180
We've already downloaded and installed everything.

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,290
So, let's jump right into the simulator itself.

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,695
The easiest way to start Carla is to use the launch script provided.

47
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,840
The script itself is used to load

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,475
the Carla session with a map or scenario of our choosing.

49
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:20,825
Here, I choose the town environment provided in Carla for our demonstration.

50
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:25,790
We can also change various configurations for our simulator session,

51
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,460
such as the simulation window size and

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,015
setting a fixed time step to be either small or large.

53
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:35,780
A Carla session can also be loaded in server mode.

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,820
This allows a programmable client to connect to the server,

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,275
and send commands to control the car

56
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:45,620
or receive information about the simulation environment.

57
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,810
Being able to program our client opens up a diverse range of possibilities.

58
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,460
From the simulator feedback,

59
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,205
we can know where every car is on the map,

60
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:59,810
develop a controller and planner to smoothly navigate our car around or

61
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,895
even use depth and segmented images to learn to detect cars and pedestrians.

62
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:09,140
Simulation results from the client can also be post-processed to

63
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,775
evaluate the performance of our current software algorithms and methods.

64
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,490
This provides insight on improvements and

65
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,175
limitations to both the simulator and algorithms.

66
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,225
For our upcoming course project,

67
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:24,920
we use these results as a way to evaluate

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,810
your algorithm's performance and to encourage exploration of the strengths,

69
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,320
as well as the weaknesses of the algorithms you are developing.

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,520
We've talked about why simulation is useful and what you can use it for,

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
and we've met Carla,

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,060
the simulator that we'll use throughout this specialization.

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,700
We've also seen some of the capabilities of

74
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,205
Carla which you'll use in the upcoming course project.

75
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:53,420
Now, before we move on to the details of the project,

76
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,850
it's time for you to take a closer look at

77
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,390
the simulator itself and to set it up on your own computer.

78
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,980
Now's the time to follow

79
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,600
those detailed instructions that will take you through the full process.

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,210
I also encourage you to consult the discussion forums if you run into any problems,

81
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,780
chances are someone's had the same issue as you before.

82
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,420
Once you have the simulator up and running and you're

83
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,000
comfortable launching and running a client,

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,320
you'll be ready to start using it for the course project.

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,460
In the next video, we'll go over the final project requirements and get you ready to

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,170
start designing controllers for your simulated self-driving vehicle. See you there.
