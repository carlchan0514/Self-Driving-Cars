1
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,675
Welcome to this week's first lesson.

2
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,190
In the previous module,

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,680
we learned some basic
longitudinal control

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,035
for autonomous car
controlled development.

5
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:31,725
In this module, we will go
through the lateral control.

6
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:34,400
We will cover four lessons this week.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,960
In the first lesson,

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,500
we'll see the introduction
to lateral vehicle control.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,225
In lessons two and three,

10
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,580
we'll introduce
two geometric path following

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,800
control strategies that are built on

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,695
the no-slip assumption
of kinematic modeling.

13
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:51,035
Finally, in the last lesson,

14
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,330
we will focus on
model predictive control,

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,500
as an example of

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,090
an advanced control strategy

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,260
regularly used in
autonomous vehicles.

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,540
In this lesson specifically,

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,470
we'll introduce the core concepts

20
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,615
needed to perform lateral control,

21
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,400
and you'll learn how to define

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,910
different types of
reference path and how

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,290
to compute heading and

24
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,130
crosstrack errors relative
to those reference paths.

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,175
So, let's get started.

26
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,210
One of the main concerns in
autonomous vehicles is ensuring

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,570
the vehicle can precisely
follow a predefined path,

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,160
executing the motion plan

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,010
devised in the higher level
planning module.

30
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,140
This is the main goal of

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,860
lateral control which must select
the steering angle required

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,140
to correct any errors that accumulate

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,560
and track changes in the path
direction as they appear.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,510
To design the lateral controller,

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,510
we need to define the error between

36
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,665
the vehicle position and the
appropriate desired path coordinates,

37
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:52,370
select a control design strategy
that drives errors to

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,140
zero while still satisfying
steering angle limits,

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,960
and consider the dynamic limitations
of vehicle and desired

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,880
ride characteristics such as

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,910
maximum lateral acceleration
and minimum jerk.

42
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,230
Control command must be cognizant
of the available tire forces and

43
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,850
not exceed the capabilities of

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,260
the vehicle when correcting
for tracking errors.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,450
The reference path is
a fundamental interface

46
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,390
between the planning system
in the lateral controller,

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,955
and can be defined in multiple ways.

48
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:26,210
The easiest approach is
to define a sequence of

49
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,820
straight line segments by requiring

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,750
a sequence of end point vertices
that are connected linearly.

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,985
This path definition can be very
compact and easy to construct,

52
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,015
assuming points are well spaced and

53
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:41,905
the environment allows for
mostly straight line motion,

54
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:44,655
as in a Manhattan grid of roadways.

55
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:48,265
However, the path includes
heading discontinuities,

56
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,550
which make precise tracking
a challenge with a steered vehicle.

57
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,030
A refinement of the line
segment approach is to

58
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,345
provide a series of
tightly spaced waypoints.

59
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:04,540
This spacing is usually fixed in
terms of distance or travel time.

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,220
The relative position
of the waypoints can be

61
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,300
restricted to satisfy
an approximate curvature constraint.

62
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,820
Waypoint paths are very common,

63
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,150
as they are easy to work with and
can be directly constructed from

64
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,520
state estimates or GPS waypoints

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,925
collected in earlier runs
of a particular route.

66
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:26,345
It is also possible to
define a path using

67
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:29,635
a sequence of continuous
parameterized curves,

68
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,390
which can be either drawn
from a fixed set of

69
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,220
motion primitives or can be

70
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,280
identified through
optimization during planning.

71
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,945
These curves provide the benefit
of continuously varying motion,

72
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:45,710
and can be constructed to have
smooth derivatives to aid in

73
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,945
the consistency of error and
error rate calculations.

74
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:52,285
In all cases of path following,

75
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:56,000
the controller tries to eliminate
the offset of the vehicle to

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
the desired path and to

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,650
align the vehicle heading
with the path heading.

78
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,140
For each of these paths definitions,

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,650
the direction of travel along
the path is also provided,

80
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,640
which can be encoded with the
point ordering or curve ordering.

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,369
We will define
these two terms shortly,

82
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,290
as they both play a critical role

83
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,185
in the design of lateral controllers.

84
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:21,365
Let's now introduced
the two main categories

85
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,820
of lateral control design,

86
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,625
which are widely used
in autonomous vehicles.

87
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,960
The first category of controllers
are geometric controllers,

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,780
which rely on the geometry
and coordinates of

89
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,395
the desired path and
the kinematic models of the vehicle.

90
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,500
We'll consider two types
of controllers that are

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,480
geometric controllers: the pure

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,935
pursuit and the Stanley controllers.

93
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,750
We'll look at these in detail in
the next lessons in this module.

94
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,070
The other category of controllers
is called dynamic controllers.

95
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,620
The most popular
advanced controller in

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,570
this category is the model
predictive controller or MPC,

97
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,060
which performs a finite
horizon optimization

98
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,485
to identify the control
command to apply.

99
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,970
MPC is commonly used because of

100
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,220
its ability to handle
a wide variety of

101
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,575
constraints and to identify

102
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,840
optimized solutions that consider

103
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,945
more than just the current errors.

104
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:22,275
We'll look at MPC design in
the final video in this module.

105
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:25,179
Let's now investigate the definitions

106
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,430
of errors in path tracking control.

107
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,770
We'll use the kinematic bicycle model

108
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,625
as our basis for this discussion.

109
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,980
So, let's quickly review

110
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,710
the important parameters
of the bicycle model.

111
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,630
The bicycle model is

112
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,530
a suitable control oriented model
of a four-wheel vehicle,

113
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,570
where the front left
and right wheels are

114
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,150
combined into
a single steerable wheel,

115
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,070
and the rear left
and right wheels are

116
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,070
combined together in
a single drive wheel.

117
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,530
For this discussion, we'll use

118
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,900
a line segment as our reference path,

119
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,240
shown as a solid black line
in the diagram.

120
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,890
A dashed black line that is
parallel to the path but

121
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,275
runs through the center of
the front axle is also visible.

122
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,950
For the purposes of lateral control,

123
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,045
we redefine our heading relative
to the current path line segment.

124
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:17,000
The variable side will
be reused to represent

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
the relative heading angle of

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,775
the vehicle with respect
to the path line.

127
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:24,800
The front wheel velocity V and

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,330
the steering angle relative to

129
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,045
the heading direction delta
do not change,

130
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,765
and are also shown in this diagram.

131
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:35,030
Note that we can place
a reference frame for

132
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,625
the vehicle at the center
of the rear axle,

133
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,665
at the center of the front axle,

134
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,970
or at the center of gravity
depending on our controller design.

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,745
As mentioned in the previous section,

136
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:51,350
we'll introduce two types of error:
heading and crosstrack error.

137
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,220
The heading error is equal to
the difference between path heading

138
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,345
and vehicle heading at
the reference point along the path.

139
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:02,570
It is a principal measure
of how well the vehicle is

140
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,620
aligned with and moving in
the direction of the desired path.

141
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,830
The rate of heading
error psi dot helps us

142
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,910
understand how the heading
error evolves over time,

143
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,820
and can be computed from the
kinematic bicycle model equations.

144
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,360
The rate of heading error
can be expressed in

145
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,020
terms of any of the three vehicle
reference points as well.

146
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,330
Here we present the rate
of heading error

147
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,280
relative to the front axle,

148
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
as will be used in

149
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,070
the Stanley controller presented

150
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,680
in the third video in this module.

151
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,035
For straight line segments,

152
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:38,720
the desired heading rate
of change is zero,

153
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,115
and it can be removed.

154
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,410
This is because
the reference heading is

155
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,615
not time-varying for a straight line,

156
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:46,505
and is in fact equal to zero,

157
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:48,215
as we have redefined our heading

158
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:50,705
relative to the current
path direction.

159
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,550
The other type of error is

160
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,655
an offset error called
the crosstrack error.

161
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,250
The crosstrack error is

162
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,350
the distance between
the reference point on

163
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,900
the vehicle and the closest point
on the desired path.

164
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,380
It is the principal
measure of how close

165
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,220
the vehicle's position is to
the desired position along the path.

166
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,730
Both heading error and crosstrack
error must converge to

167
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,530
zero for the vehicle to be properly
tracking the desired path.

168
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,350
The line from the vehicle
reference point to

169
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,860
the path reference point is
perpendicular to the path.

170
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,609
The rate of change of the
crosstrack error can be calculated

171
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:31,360
by extracting the lateral component
of the forward velocity.

172
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,305
From this equation, we can see
that as the velocity increases,

173
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,965
the crosstrack error
changes more quickly,

174
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:40,730
meaning that smaller steering
angles are needed to

175
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,790
correct for the same size
crosstrack errors.

176
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,880
Extending this discussion
of the heading and

177
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,205
crosstrack errors to the curved paths

178
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,275
adds some additional complexity,

179
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,420
as it is not immediately clear where

180
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,690
the reference point on
the curved path should lie.

181
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,150
The geometric relations required

182
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,400
fall outside the scope of this video.

183
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,285
We've nonetheless provided links
in the supplemental materials

184
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:06,605
for those interested in

185
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:09,770
error calculations
relative to curved paths.

186
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,805
Let's summarize our discussion
of the lateral control concepts.

187
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:17,810
In this lesson, you've studied
three approaches to defining

188
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,200
reference paths: line segments,
waypoints, and curves.

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,360
You've learned how to construct
error metrics for lateral control,

190
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,805
including heading and
crosstrack error.

191
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:30,320
In the next video,

192
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
we'll use these definitions to

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,775
construct our first lateral
vehicle controller,

194
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,785
the pure pursuit controller,

195
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,690
to define steering commands that will

196
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,360
track our reference path.
See you there.
