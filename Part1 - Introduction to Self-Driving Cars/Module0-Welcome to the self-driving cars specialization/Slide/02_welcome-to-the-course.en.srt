00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,915
Welcome to the first course of the University of Toronto self-driving car specialization.

2
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:29,085
My name is Steven and I'll be your instructor throughout this course.

3
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:32,190
This course is designed to introduce you to the world of

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,490
autonomous vehicles or more simply self-driving cars.

5
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,795
We'll start off by identifying what we mean by the driving task,

6
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,960
and then list out elements of driving;

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,290
all those things that you do automatically when you're behind the steering wheel,

8
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,805
this includes many perception tasks, identifying road signs,

9
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,695
other vehicles and pedestrians,

10
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,380
and predicting their actions,

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,800
as well as making many kinds of decisions to maneuver safely through traffic.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,605
Then, we'll go through the different ways to design

13
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:03,920
a basic self-driving car hardware configuration,

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,320
discuss a generic software stack to

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,670
decompose the driving task into manageable components,

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,835
and discuss how to represent the perceived environment for decision-making.

17
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:17,570
Next, we will study how to incorporate safety considerations

18
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,735
into autonomous vehicle design both in software and in hardware.

19
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:25,850
From there, we will move into vehicle modelling and control where we will

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,215
develop a vehicle model that captures longitudinal and lateral dynamics,

21
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,775
define a controller that regulates the speed of the vehicle,

22
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:37,610
define a path following controller to track a desired path,

23
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,740
and even look at state of the art model

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,825
predictive trajectory controllers for precisely executing challenging maneuvers.

25
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,400
At the end of this course,

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,540
you will work on a realistic project that will navigate a self-driving car around

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,285
a race track in the CARLA simulation environment

28
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:55,940
which I'll introduce to you later in this course.

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,640
You'll test the limits of your control design,

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,425
and learn the challenges inherent in driving at the limit of vehicle performance.

31
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:05,600
These topics should establish

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,015
the basic terminology for self-driving use throughout the specialization,

33
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:14,120
list out the most important requirements for building self-driving solutions,

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,460
and show how you can execute a dynamic driving maneuver in a self-driving car.

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,910
I'm very excited to be introducing you to these ideas.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,490
I hope they will be useful for you as you go

37
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,345
forth to help make self-driving vehicles a part of our daily lives.

38
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,865
So, let's get started,

39
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:34,510
it's a great day to build self-driving cars.
