  Paywalls
 </h2>
 <p>
  While many of the articles in our Supplementary Readings are freely available, you may also experience a 'paywall' for some of the scientific journals and research articles.
  <strong>
   You are not required to purchase these articles in order to complete the graded assignments or the course.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If you cannot purchase these articles, we recommend that you visit your local university library or city library. Typically, the university Internet and library services can provide these scientific articles to you without the need to pay. Ask your local librarian for more information.

  So What?
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you're interested in becoming a self-driving car engineer, you will need to continuously read up on the latest research and industry articles about what's happening in the field. Consider this an opportunity to start developing this habit (if you haven't already)!
