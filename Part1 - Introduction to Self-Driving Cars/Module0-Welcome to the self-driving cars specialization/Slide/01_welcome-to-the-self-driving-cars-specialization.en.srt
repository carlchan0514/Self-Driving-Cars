00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,965
We'll be your instructors throughout this specialization.

5
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:39,330
The self-driving car is the sleeping giant which can change everything;

00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,650
road safety, mobility for everyone,

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,440
while dramatically reducing the costs of driving.

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,270
This specialization will teach you what you need to

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,305
know to kick start a career in the autonomous driving industry.

10
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,080
Whether you're coming from academia or industry,

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,470
these courses will provide you with the foundational knowledge and

12
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,185
practical skills you need to help build a new future with self-driving cars.

13
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:07,225
Throughout the courses, we'll show you real-world data and scenarios from our research,

14
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:11,435
and from our own self-driving car or what we call the autonomous.

15
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:14,555
After decades of applied and award winning research,

16
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:17,090
we at the University of Toronto are excited

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,820
to show you the nuts and bolts of autonomous driving.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,495
There are a total of four courses in this specialization.

19
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,950
In the first course,

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,405
I'll introduce you to the self-driving car software and hardware architectures.

21
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:30,950

32
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,220
By the end of this course,

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,345

44
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:01,870
You'll apply these methods to vehicle tracking and drivable surface estimation.

45
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,910

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
and gain valuable experience in debugging and

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,990
testing self-driving algorithms in the Carla simulator.

59
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,270
So, by the end of this specialization,

60
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,300
you will have a detailed understanding of the architecture and components of

61
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,105
the autonomous driving software stack and you will program your own self-driving car.

62
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:08,600
Since we're teaching you how to program your own self-driving car,

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,320
the courses in this specialization have several prerequisites.

64
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,780
First, you should be proficient in linear algebra and be familiar with matrices,

65
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,885
vectors, matrix multiplication, rank,

66
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,500
eigenvalues in vectors and inverses.

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,384
This background will help you with control,

68
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:31,100
state estimation, perception, and planning algorithms throughout the courses.

69
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,625
You should also be comfortable with statistics.

70
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,345
In particular, working with Gaussian probability distributions.

71
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,665
This knowledge will be important for state estimation,

72
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:43,760
and for perception when we're estimating vehicle speed and

73
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,920
heading from GPS and inertial measurements for example.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,940
You should also be comfortable with basic calculus and physics,

75
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,225
such as forces, moments,

76
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,305
inertia, and Newton's laws.

77
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,110
It's certainly helpful to know how to drive a car,

78
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,690
but since the cars will be self-driving,

79
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,765
it's not a hard requirement for this specialization.

80
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:05,815
If you don't have these necessary pre-requisites,

81
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,579
there are excellent robotics, AI,

82
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,180
deep learning, and other courses that you can take on

83
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,240
Coursera to prepare you for this specialization.

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,295
Autonomous driving is a constantly evolving and changing field.

85
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:22,820
So, keeping up not only with self-driving knowledge but also robotics,

86
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,035
AI, and deep learning will help you keep your technical skills sharp.

87
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,670
There's a long way to go,

88
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,100
and we need pioneers to help us get there.

89
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,900
So, are you ready for the ride?
