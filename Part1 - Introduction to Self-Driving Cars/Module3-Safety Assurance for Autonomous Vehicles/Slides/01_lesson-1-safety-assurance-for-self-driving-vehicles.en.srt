00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,780
Welcome to the third week of this course.

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,240
This week we will dive into the basics of

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,615
incorporating safety into autonomous vehicle design.

4
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:30,815
Throughout this module, we'll discuss

5
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:34,340
some of the recent autonomous vehicle crash reports,

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,940
then we will formally define safety concepts for self-driving cars,

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,090
and discuss the most common sources of hazard that occur.

8
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,360
We'll discuss some industry perspectives on safety, and finally,

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,040
we'll wrap up by discussing some of

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,880
the common frameworks that are used in safe system design.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,970
In this lesson, we will discuss some of

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:01,655
the first incidence of self-driving car crashes from 2017 and 2018.

13
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:05,780
Then, we will define some basic safety concepts and

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,119
list some of the most common causes for autonomous vehicle hazards,

15
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,600
and discuss the low level and high level requirements for safety.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,750
We should point out that the material in this module is

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,300
mostly taken from the published guidelines,

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,600
by the International Organization for Standards, ISO.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,290
You'll find a more comprehensive version of these frameworks online.

20
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,160
Let's start with a discussion of some of

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,840
the more prominent autonomous vehicle failures to date.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,640
In March 2016, a self-driving Google car now Waymo,

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,170
ran into the side of a bus when it attempted to

24
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,815
pull out from behind an obstacle in its way.

25
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:50,105
A bus was approaching from the rear and was aiming to pass the Google car in its lane,

26
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:53,705
which was over to the right of its lane prepared to turn.

27
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:58,310
The Google car software believed the bus would not attempt to pass it,

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,125
as the gap between itself and the cars in the next lane was too narrow.

29
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,740
It turns out buses habitually shoot through smaller gaps

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,685
than Google anticipated leading to the crash in this case.

31
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:13,340
By the time the Google car could react to

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,490
the new measurements of the bus location, it was too late.

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,160
This is just one example of how hard it is to

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,065
predict all other vehicles actions before they happen.

35
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:27,530
A year later, an Uber self-driving vehicle overreacted during

36
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,975
a minor collision caused by another vehicle and ended up overturning.

37
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:35,090
Since the dynamic models of the vehicle don't assume

38
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,455
significant disturbance forces from other vehicles acting on the car,

39
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:44,510
the controller had likely not been tested for such a scenario and overreacted.

40
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,500
This crash highlights the need for robustness integrated into

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,330
the control system and for

42
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,360
exploratory testing that covers as many foreseeable events as possible.

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,900
In the late 2017,

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,350
a GM Cruise Chevy Bolt knocked over

45
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,345
a motorcyclist after it aborted a lane change maneuver.

46
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:08,124
After the Bolt initiated the maneuver,

47
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,400
the gap it was hoping to enter closed

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,210
rapidly due to a braking lead vehicle in the adjacent lane.

49
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,060
The motorcyclist who was lane splitting,

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,175
moved forward beside the Bolt and blocked the return maneuver.

51
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:24,100
The Bolt was stuck in a dilemma situation;

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,880
to collide with the motorcycle or to crash into both cars in the adjacent lane.

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,465
It's not clear that a specific decision was made here to choose one or the other outcome,

54
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,665
and a lawsuit has buried the details of the case.

55
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:43,280
However, because other agents are also predicting the self-driving cars actions,

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,510
it is very challenging to assess what the right action is in many situations.

57
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,900
As it's possible, the merging might have been possible with

58
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,240
a more aggressive driving style or

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,670
a slightly delayed abort might have been enough time to avoid the motorcyclist.

60
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,030
This tight interaction of decision-making is still a big challenge in self-driving cars.

61
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,320
Finally, we should talk a little bit about the Uber crash that

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,495
led to a pedestrian fatality in early 2018.

63
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:16,035
Operating in Tempe, Arizona,

64
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:19,100
Uber had an extensive testing program at the time,

65
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,800
with safety drivers monitoring the autonomy software.

66
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,940
The incident occurred on a wide multilane divided road at night,

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,740
where a pedestrian was walking her bicycle across the road in an unmarked area.

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,855
The victim, Elaine Herzberg,

69
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,560
was a 49 year-old woman from Tempe.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,935
This is the car and the scene depicted from a bird's eye view.

71
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:46,310
You can see the pedestrian entering from the left and

72
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,495
the vehicle traveling along the road way from the bottom of the image.

73
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:53,570
The preliminary investigation revealed that there

74
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,480
were multiple failures that led to the incident.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,750
Let's walk through the different contributing factors.

76
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,955
First, there were no real-time checks on the safety driver.

77
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:09,350
In this case, the safety driver was inattentive and allegedly watching Hulu at the time.

78
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,415
The safety driver could have been doing anything and Uber didn't have

79
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:17,390
any way in the vehicle to assess the drivers attentiveness.

80
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,720
Because watching an autonomous driving system operate

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,090
is a difficult task to stay focused on,

82
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,150
it is really important to have a safety driver monitoring system.

83
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,285
Second, there was significant confusion in the software detection system.

84
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:36,035
Upon initial detection at six seconds to impact,

85
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,560
the victim was first classified as an unknown object,

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,305
then misclassified as a vehicle,

87
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:44,990
and then misclassified as a bicycle.

88
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,015
In the end, the decision made by the autonomy software was to ignore the detections,

89
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,610
possibly because they were too unreliable.

90
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,855
Perception is not perfect and the switching classifications

91
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:01,680
should not have led the vehicle to ignore an object like that completely.

92
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,760
Finally, 1.3 seconds before the crash,

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,755
the Volvo emergency braking system did detect the pedestrian

94
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:14,179
and would have applied the brakes rapidly to reduce the impact speed,

95
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:17,665
potentially saving the life of Elaine Herzberg.

96
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,820
However, it is not safe to have

97
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,335
multiple collision avoidance systems operating simultaneously during testing,

98
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:29,365
so Uber had disabled the Volvo system when in autonomous mode.

99
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:34,415
Ultimately, the autonomous vehicle did not react to the pedestrian's path

100
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:39,560
and the inattentive driver was unable to react quickly enough to avoid the collision.

101
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,690
The combination of the failure of

102
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,395
the perception system to correctly identify the pedestrian,

103
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,680
with a bicycle and of the planning system to

104
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,425
avoid the detective object even though it's class was uncertain,

105
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,750
led to the autonomy failure,

106
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,680
and the lack of human or emergency braking backup ultimately led to the fatality.

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,995
So, we can see that from this set of incidents,

108
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:07,020
every aspect of the autonomous driving system;

109
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,645
the perception, planning, and control,

110
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,390
can all lead to failures and crashes,

111
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,045
and that often the interaction of multiple systems or multiple decision-makers,

112
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:20,045
can lead to unanticipated consequences.

113
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:24,575
In fact, there are many more ways an autonomous system can fail.

114
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:29,600
It is clear that we need rigorous and exhaustive approaches to safety,

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,965
and both industry and the regulators are tackling the safety challenge head-on.

116
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:38,480
Okay. Now, that we have a sense for the challenges of safety assessment,

117
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,330
let's formally define some basic safety terms.

118
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,030
We will use the term,

119
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,905
harm to refer to the physical harm to a living thing,

120
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:52,550
and we will use the term risk to describe the probability that an event occurs,

121
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,100
combined with the severity of the harm,

122
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,260
that the event can cause.

123
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,770
We can now describe safety as the process of

124
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,385
avoiding unreasonable risk of harm to a living thing.

125
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:07,310
For example, driving into an intersection when

126
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,415
the traffic signal is red would be unsafe as it leads to

127
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,400
unreasonable risk to harm of the occupants of

128
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,840
the vehicle and to other vehicles moving through the intersection.

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,785
Finally, a hazard is a potential source of

130
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:25,285
unreasonable risk of harm or a threat to safety.

131
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:30,245
So, if my system software has a bug that could potentially cause an accident,

132
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,945
the software bug would be a hazard.

133
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:39,310
Now, what do you think are the most common sources of autonomous vehicle hazards?

134
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,355
Well, hazards can be mechanical,

135
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:47,405
so maybe incorrect assembly of a brake system causing a premature failure.

136
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,325
They can be electrical,

137
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:53,935
so faulty internal wiring leading to a loss of indicator lighting.

138
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:59,900
Hazards could also be a failure of computing hardware chips used for autonomous driving.

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,510
They can, as described earlier,

140
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,810
be due to errors or bugs in the autonomy software.

141
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,345
They might be caused by bad or noisy sensor data or inaccurate perception.

142
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:18,635
Hazards can also arise due to incorrect planning or decision-making,

143
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:21,720
inadvertently selecting hazardous actions because

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,005
the behavior selection for a specific scenario wasn't designed correctly.

145
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:29,660
It's also possible that the fallback to a human driver

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,570
fails by not providing enough warning to

147
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,770
the driver to resume responsibility or

148
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,675
maybe a self-driving car gets hacked by some malicious entity.

149
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:42,780
These are all the main categories of hazards that are

150
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,025
regularly considered; mechanical, electrical,

151
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:49,635
computing hardware, software, perception,

152
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:54,200
planning, driving-task fallback, and cybersecurity.

153
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,605
Each of these hazards requires different approaches when assessing overall system safety.

154
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:04,250
We'll see more on how to deal with these categories in later videos.

155
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,115
Now that we know the basic terminology involved in safety,

156
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:10,260
let's think about the following question.

157
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,395
How do we ensure our self-driving car is truly safe?

158
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:20,310
That is, how do we take the complex task of driving and the many hazards that can occur,

159
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,280
and define a safety assessment framework for a complete self-driving system?

160
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,165
In the US, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration or NHTSA,

161
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,095
has defined a twelve-part safety framework

162
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:36,985
to structure safety assessment for autonomous driving.

163
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,655
As we'll see in the next videos in this module,

164
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:43,970
this framework is only a starting point and different approaches that combine

165
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,950
multiple existing methods and standards have already emerged in the industry.

166
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,890
So, let's first discuss the NHTSA's safety recommendations.

167
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,700
This framework was released as a suggested,

168
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,565
not mandatory framework to follow in 2017.

169
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:04,420
The framework itself consists of 12 areas or

170
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,870
elements any autonomous driving company should focus on or rather,

171
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,140
are encouraged to focus on.

172
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,055
First, a system design approach to safety should be adopted,

173
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:18,520
and this really permeates the entire framework document.

174
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,625
Well-planned and controlled software development processes are essential,

175
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:28,305
and the application of existing SAE and ISO standards from automotive,

176
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:32,855
aerospace, and other relevant industries should be applied where relevant.

177
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:35,360
For the remaining 11 areas,

178
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,525
we can organize them loosely into two categories.

179
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:42,160
Autonomy design, which requires certain components to

180
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,955
be included and considered in the autonomy software stack,

181
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,235
and testing and crash mitigation,

182
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,490
which covers approaches to testing

183
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,015
the autonomy functions and ways to reduce the negative effects of failures,

184
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,895
as well as learning from them.

185
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:59,060
In the autonomy design category,

186
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,690
we see some components we're already familiar with.

187
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,625
The NHTSA encourages a well-defined operational design domain,

188
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,240
so that the designers are well aware of the flaws of this and limitations of the system,

189
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,080
and can make an assessment as to which scenarios are

190
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,730
supported and safe in advance of testing or deployment.

191
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,495
Next, it encourages a well-tested object and event detection and response system,

192
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:27,165
which is critical to perception and crash avoidance.

193
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,840
Then, it encourages the car to have

194
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,340
a reliable and convenient fallback mechanism by which

195
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,445
the driver is alerted or the car is brought to safety autonomously.

196
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:39,950
It is essential to develop this mechanism

197
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,900
keeping in mind that the driver may be inattentive.

198
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,570
So, some thoughts should go into how to bring

199
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,885
the system to a minimal risk condition if this happens.

200
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:54,450
The driving system should also be designed such that all the federal level, state level,

201
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:00,530
and local laws for traffic are followed and obeyed within the ODD.

202
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,200
Next, the framework encourages designers to think about cybersecurity threats,

203
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,015
and how to protect the driving system from malicious agents.

204
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:14,635
Finally, there should be some thought put into the human machine interface, or HMI.

205
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:18,250
So, the car should be able to well convey the status of

206
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,520
the machine at any point in time to the passengers or the driver.

207
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,780
Important examples of status information that can be displayed,

208
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,230
are whether all sensors are operational,

209
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,375
what the current motion plans are,

210
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,860
which objects in the environment are affecting our driving behavior, and so on.

211
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,120
We now move to the testing and crash mitigation areas.

212
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,980
First and foremost, the NHTSA recommends

213
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,565
a strong and extensive testing program before any service is launched for the public.

214
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:51,885
This testing can rely on three common pillars;

215
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:54,750
simulation, close track testing,

216
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,410
and public road driving.

217
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,330
Next, there should be careful consideration of methods to

218
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,210
mitigate the extent of injury or damage that occurs during a crash event.

219
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,530
Crashes remain a reality of public road driving and autonomy systems that can

220
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,740
minimize crash energy and exceed passenger safety standards in terms of restraints,

221
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,440
airbags, and crash worthiness should be the norm.

222
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,200
Next, there should be support for post crash behavior.

223
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,425
The car must be rapidly returned to a safe state, for example,

224
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:31,120
brought to a stop with fuel pumps securing the fuel,

225
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,890
first responders alerted, and so on.

226
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,310
Further, there should be an automated data recording function or black box recorder.

227
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,930
It is very helpful to have this crash data to analyze and

228
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,855
design systems that can avoid the specific kind of crash in the future,

229
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:49,685
and to resolve questions about what went wrong,

230
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:52,150
and who was at fault during the event.

231
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,405
Finally, there should be well-defined consumer education and training.

232
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:02,870
So, courses for the fallback driver during testing and training for consumer drivers and

233
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,995
passengers to better understand

234
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:09,550
both the capabilities and limits of the deployed autonomous system.

235
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,755
This final step is essential to ensuring our natural overconfidence in automation,

236
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:20,990
does not lead to unnecessary hazards being introduced by early adopters.

237
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,450
Keep in mind that these are suggested areas that any company should work on.

238
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,190
Not mandatory requirements, yet.

239
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,870
The main objective of the NHTSA is to guide companies

240
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,845
building self-driving cars without overly restricting innovation.

241
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:38,150
We're pre-selecting technologies.

242
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,575
As entrance to the market start to emerge,

243
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:45,660
it is likely that more definitive requirements for safety assessment will also emerge.

244
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,890
Okay. Let's summarize.

245
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,860
In this video, we discussed a

246
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,850
few of the first accidents that the self-driving industry has seen,

247
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,030
and revealed the many ways in which autonomy software can fail.

248
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,080
We then formally defined harm, risk, hazard,

249
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,535
and safety, and listed out the major sources of autonomous vehicle hazards.

250
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:12,565
We then reviewed the NHTSA safety framework.

251
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:17,770
In the next video, we'll discuss some industry perspectives on self-driving safety,

252
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,270
as well as some safety recommendations for self-driving cars. See you then.
