00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,815
Welcome to the second lesson this week.

2
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:21,960
In this lesson, we will discuss the various industry perspectives on safety and testing.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,210
Specifically, we'll first analyze

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,115
the safety perspectives of two big names in the industry: Waymo and GM.

5
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:32,430
Then we'll discuss two different approaches to assessing

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,865
safety: analytical versus empirical. Let's begin.

7
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:39,275
As we saw in the last video,

8
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,800
the NHTSA requested that each self-driving developer,

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,640
should develop and describe a comprehensive safety strategy that

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,725
covered the 12 concepts included in their guidance document.

11
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:55,230
To date, two prominent reports have emerged from Waymo and GM,

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,785
and we'll use both as our basis for our discussion of industry approaches to safety.

13
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:04,550
The Waymo Safety Report was released in 2017,

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,625
and has a lot of great insight into how to organize

15
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,530
a comprehensive safety strategy for self-driving cars.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,630
Waymo covers all 12 of the NHTSA concepts,

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,325
but organizes them into a five level safety approach.

18
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:25,190
First, Waymo systems are designed to perform safe driving at the behavioral level.

19
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,330
This includes decisions that follow the traffic rules,

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,870
can handle a wide range of scenarios within the ODD,

21
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,840
and maintain vehicle safety through it.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,525
Second, Waymo ensures that the systems have backups and redundancies.

23
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:45,410
This is so that even if a fault or failure occurs,

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,940
the car can switch to a secondary component or a backup process to

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,770
minimize the severity of failures and return the vehicle to a safe state,

26
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,230
continuing the drive if possible.

27
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,410
This is referred to as Functional Safety.

28
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,055
Next, Waymo emphasizes crash safety as recommended by the NHTSA.

29
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:09,620
It designs systems that ensure minimum damage

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,640
to people inside the car in the event of a crash.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,500
Next, it tries to ensure Operational Safety.

32
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,700
So, that means its interfaces are usable and convenient and intuitive.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,220
The focus here is on allowing passengers to have some level of control over the vehicle,

34
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,960
but only in ways that maintain system safety.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,530
Finally, Waymo fosters Non-collision safety.

36
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,170
This refers to system designs that minimize

37
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,530
the danger to people that may interact with the system in some way,

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,640
first responders, mechanics, hardware engineers, and so on.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,075
These five pillars form Waymo's safety by design system,

40
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:55,939
and leads to a system of extensive requirement definition, design iteration,

41
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:01,390
and testing to ensure that the objectives of the system are met by each component.

42
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,010
The process uses several tools from

43
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,300
existing domains and we'll go into more details of these tools in the next video.

44
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,990
At the outset, the Waymo team identifies as many hazard scenarios

45
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,385
as possible and analyzes possible mitigation strategies for each,

46
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:22,280
that is, how to ensure that the vehicle can

47
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,970
still reach a safe state when a hazard occurs.

48
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,360
Then, they use a hazard assessment method to identify more specific safety requirements.

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,240
The various methods they use are preliminary analysis of possible safety risk,

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,150
a fault tree hazard assessment which works from the

51
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,395
top down in terms of the dynamic driving task,

52
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:49,355
and some design failure modes and effects analysis which works from the bottom-up

53
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,960
assessing the effects of

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,555
small subsystem failures on the overall capabilities of the system.

55
00:03:55,555 --> 00:04:01,415
Finally, they perform lots of testing to ensure that the requirements are met.

56
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:04,700
Let's discuss the kind of testing procedures that Waymo

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,685
follows specifically to evaluate its software,

58
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:11,905
as it is the most publicly visible and well-documented program out there.

59
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:14,660
First, they test all software changes in

60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,160
simulation on the order of 10 million miles of simulation per day.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,970
This represents an enormous computing effort running continuously to

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,875
confirm the expected improvements to safety requirements for the system.

63
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,210
To do this, they mine all of their on-road experiences for challenging

64
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,665
scenarios and perform systematic scenario fuzzing,

65
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:38,630
which changes the position and

66
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,470
velocity parameters of other vehicles and pedestrians randomly,

67
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,610
so they can test if the ego-vehicle behaves safely throughout all of them.

68
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,860
This approach is particularly useful for finding hard edge cases,

69
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,915
with hard to resolve time gaps for merging or crossing intersections for example.

70
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,675
Then they do Closed-course Testing,

71
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,900
in which they test their software on private tracks.

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,570
They cover 28 core scenarios as identified by an UC Berkeley study,

73
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,455
as well as 19 additional scenarios that Waymo added.

74
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:15,140
These scenarios are organized around avoiding

75
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,130
the four most common accident scenarios which are rear-end,

76
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,525
intersection, road departure, and lane change.

77
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:27,110
There are obviously many variations of each of these categories but

78
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,470
together they account for over 84 percent of all crashes.

79
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,120
Finally, they do real-world testing which are

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,110
regularly seen on the streets of many different cities in the United States,

81
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,070
including Mountain View California right near the main Google campus.

82
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,590
This testing allows them to identify

83
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,645
more and more cases that are out of the ordinary and primarily rely

84
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:52,674
on the dynamic driving task fallback strategy

85
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:56,875
of having humans monitor the autonomy software during testing.

86
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:02,350
The combination of these strategies for testing is by no means unique to Waymo,

87
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,560
but has emerged as the de facto standard as it provides

88
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,625
the maximum flexibility and feedback for a fixed investment,

89
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,700
focusing each test method on what it does best,

90
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,450
simulation on manipulating scenarios that make them hard,

91
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,320
closed-course testing on confirming specific gains in

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,870
safety performance and real-world testing on finding evermore challenging scenarios,

93
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,100
and increasing public confidence in the technology.

94
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,550
Okay. Now let's turn our attention to the safety ideology for General Motors,

95
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,690
who acquired Cruise Automation in 2016 and has propelled

96
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,680
itself to a leading position in self-driving development as a result.

97
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,290
GM strategy follows the NHTSA safety framework very

98
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,370
closely and addresses each of the 12 main areas individually.

99
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,400
GM's safety strategy does not try to reorganize or simplify the NHTSA guidance,

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
but instead focuses on

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,180
its implementation strategies for achieving the required safety assessments.

102
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,220
First and foremost, GM emphasized their iterative design model,

103
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,690
in which the first analyze scenarios,

104
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,200
then build software, then simulate the scenarios,

105
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,820
and test their software.

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,730
Finally, deploy their software on real world cars,

107
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,920
and they keep adding improvements and refinements to

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,985
both the requirements and the autonomous system iteratively.

109
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:33,110
Second, whereas Waymo relies on OEMs to design

110
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,060
its vehicles and only discusses

111
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,660
mechanical and electrical hazards related to its autonomy hardware,

112
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,295
GM manufactures their cars entirely themselves and so can enforce

113
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,350
a more integrated design with

114
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,360
consistent quality standards throughout the self-driving hardware.

115
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,680
Next, GM ensures safety through a comprehensive risk management scheme.

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,920
They identify and address risks and try

117
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,325
to eliminate them completely and not just mitigate them.

118
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:07,235
Finally, all their systems follow there internally well defined standards of safety,

119
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:10,040
reliability, security, and so on.

120
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,450
They have years of experience of developing vehicles in the automotive industry,

121
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,230
and have developed extensive safety processes as a result.

122
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,745
Their safety processes involve three types of analysis.

123
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:25,820
First, they perform deductive analysis through

124
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,190
the fault tree method and pinpoint

125
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,220
components that could possibly have faults and address them.

126
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,465
Next, they perform inductive analysis through design, FMEA.

127
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:42,010
So, they do a failure modes and effect analysis on their design proposals,

128
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,340
and try to ensure safety from the bottom up.

129
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,820
Finally, they employ hazard and operability studies to perform exploratory analysis,

130
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,855
and figure out when the system may potentially not work as expected.

131
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,540
Now, this may all sound familiar and indeed,

132
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,140
these are the same pillars of analysis that Waymo describes.

133
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,720
In the next video, we'll go through more details on how these methods actually work.

134
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,040
Let's talk about safety thresholds and GM vehicles.

135
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,190
All GM vehicles have to follow two critical safety thresholds at the very least.

136
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,680
First, the GM defines a clear set of fail safes, back-up systems,

137
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,350
and redundancies for different components so

138
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,830
that the system continues to work even after a failure.

139
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,680
Second, the components must pass

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,690
the SOTIF evaluation which we'll discuss in more detail in the next video.

141
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,480
With this evaluation, we ensure that

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,465
all critical functionalities are evaluated in both known and unknown scenarios.

143
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:52,445
Finally, GM follows a rigorous testing mechanism consisting of performance testing,

144
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,770
requirements validation, fault injection,

145
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,040
intrusive testing, and durability tests, and simulation-based testing.

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,380
Both these companies rigorously follow safety standards and are

147
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,745
therefore great examples of how to do safety practically and effectively.

148
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:14,710
So, we now have a clearer picture of how safety assessment is performed in industry,

149
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,580
but we're still left with this question: is it really possible to

150
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,855
truly precisely assess whether an autonomous car is safe?

151
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,050
Or at least safer than a human driver?

152
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,170
Let's discuss the various approaches that can be

153
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,575
used to assess the safety of an autonomous driving system.

154
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,990
We have two possible approaches: analytical or data-driven safety assessment.

155
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,495
By analytical safety assessment,

156
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:43,330
we mean that the system can be analyzed to define

157
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,120
quantifiable safety performance or

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,995
failure rates based on critical assessment of hazards and scenarios.

159
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:55,150
If the overall system failure rates can be determined through analysis,

160
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,060
it can provide strong guidance on which aspects of

161
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,065
the system are the biggest contributors to overall safety.

162
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:07,000
A great example is the Space Shuttle program for which initial estimates of

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,920
analytical failure rates were pegged at one in 100,000 flights.

164
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,230
After the program ended however,

165
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,405
a forensic study revealed that

166
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:21,040
early shuttle program flights had failure rates closer to one in 10,

167
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,730
and that this only progressed to one in a hundred by the end of the program.

168
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,450
It is a marvel that such analysis is even possible for

169
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,270
such a complex system when considering all of

170
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,315
the thousands of subsystems that go into a shuttle launch,

171
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:38,905
and all of the millions of variables that can affect the operations of these systems.

172
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:43,765
This sort of detailed analysis is also applicable to self-driving cars,

173
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:46,750
but may arguably be more complex due to

174
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,680
the infinite variety of situations of vehicle confined itself in.

175
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,770
In the end, analytic methods can only

176
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,775
provide guidance on the safety performance of the self-driving system,

177
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:01,705
and their results need to be validated through experience.

178
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:05,830
To evaluate experience, we use data-driven testing.

179
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,560
This is the concept whereby we are assured that

180
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,905
the system is safe because it has demonstrated that,

181
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,260
using a specific version of the software,

182
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,260
it can achieve desired failure rates on a set of

183
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,715
roads and scenarios that are included in the operational design domain.

184
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,740
In the case of self-driving,

185
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,600
these desired failure rates can be tied to human level driving performance,

186
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,500
where we hope to reduce accidents by 10x or 100x over the performance of today's drivers.

187
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,915
So, what does the data say?

188
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:41,005
Are autonomous cars actually safer?

189
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:45,550
First, know the driving is still dangerous by human standards.

190
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,810
A report in 2015 concluded that of all the fatalities in driving,

191
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,380
about 90 percent of these occurred due to human errors,

192
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,540
sometimes through a lack of judgment,

193
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,110
sometimes through a failure of human perception, et cetera.

194
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,580
But humans are also extremely good at driving, and indeed,

195
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,190
the entire driving environment has been designed

196
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,130
based on human perception and planning abilities.

197
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,555
In the United States,

198
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:15,610
there is roughly one fatality per 146 million kilometres driven.

199
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,285
One injury per 2.1 million kilometres driven,

200
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:23,500
and approximately one collision per 400,000 kilometres.

201
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,570
This last number is only estimated as most smaller collisions are not actually reported.

202
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,360
In fact, autonomous driving may do a lot to

203
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,420
shed more light on these statistics as much more

204
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,270
comprehensive reporting and reconstruction will be

205
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,900
possible with the additional sensors available to us.

206
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,565
Now, let's consider the preliminary self-driving vehicle statistics,

207
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,670
more specifically, the disengagement rates

208
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,140
published by all autonomous driving vehicles being tested in California.

209
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,890
A disengagement is when either this autonomy software requests

210
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,120
the driver to take over control or the safety driver feels the need to intervene.

211
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,140
It is understandably challenging to get true crash statistics for

212
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,120
the entire fleets being tested as these are sensitive statistics.

213
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,795
Fortunately, testing in California comes along with some useful reporting requirements.

214
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:23,200
In 2017, Waymo drove 563,000 kilometres in California and

215
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,380
experienced 63 disengagement for

216
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,685
a rate of roughly one disengagement every 9,000 kilometres.

217
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:35,290
GM Cruise drove 210,000 kilometres in California with

218
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,195
105 disengagement for roughly one every 2,000 kilometres.

219
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:43,870
Both were improving quickly throughout the year reaching

220
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,680
disengagement rates of once every 12,500 kilometres,

221
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,780
and every 8,300 kilometres respectively for the last three months of the year.

222
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,240
These are hard numbers to relate to in terms of human performance but roughly mean that

223
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,715
a typical commuter would only have to

224
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:04,735
intervene once a year for a failure of the autonomy system.

225
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:08,560
This is enormous progress but also still a ways off from the

226
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,770
400,000 kilometres between crashes that humans achieve on trillions of miles every year.

227
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,365
The primary causes of the 63 Waymo disengagements in order of frequency,

228
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,795
were unwanted vehicle manoeuvres,

229
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:26,650
perception discrepancies, hardware issues,

230
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,680
software issues, behavior predictions,

231
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,385
and finally, a single case of a reckless road user.

232
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:36,475
It's clear that the core tasks of perception,

233
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:40,450
prediction and behavior planning remain challenging problems,

234
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,790
and much work still needs to be done.

235
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,570
Lastly, a word about statistical significance.

236
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,575
The performance observed from today's fleet are impressive,

237
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,375
but how well do they represent an accurate comparison to human capabilities?

238
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,060
How many miles do we really need to drive to

239
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,765
demonstrate autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers,

240
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:05,050
particularly in terms of fatalities?

241
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,285
In the supplemental material,

242
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:09,310
we've included a link to a report by

243
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,415
Rand Corporation that attempts to address this question,

244
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,350
and the numbers are startling.

245
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,825
Since fatalities are such rare events and with a numerous factors under consideration,

246
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,890
the report states that upwards of 8 billion miles would be needed if

247
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,960
pure on road testing is used to validate the safety case for a self-driving system.

248
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,335
It would take at least 400 years to do so with a fleet of 100 vehicles traveling 24/7,

249
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,450
that's a long time to wait.

250
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,205
It is for this reason that we see such multifaceted approaches to safety,

251
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,355
and every company is expanding vehicle fleets

252
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:49,195
to increase the experience gained with autonomous systems on the road.

253
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,865
To summarize, in this video,

254
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:56,275
we looked at two industry perspectives on autonomous driving safety assessment,

255
00:16:56,275 --> 00:17:00,775
Waymo and GM, and found many methods borrowed from other industries.

256
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:03,460
We discussed the current disengagement rates and

257
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,160
road testing requirements to demonstrate better than human performance.

258
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,560
In the next lesson, we'll explore a few of

259
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,810
the most commonly used safety framework and methodologies. We'll see you there.
