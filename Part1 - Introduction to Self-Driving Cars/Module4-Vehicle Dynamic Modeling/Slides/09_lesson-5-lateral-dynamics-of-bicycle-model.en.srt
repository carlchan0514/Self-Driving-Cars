1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,020
In the previous video,

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,545
we covered longitudinal dynamics for the vehicle.

3
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,440
In this lesson, we will cover the dynamic modeling of

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,325
a four-wheel car based on the bicycle modeling approach.

5
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:28,035
By the end of this video,

6
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:29,670
you will be able to;

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,995
build a dynamic model of a car using the kinematic bicycle model as a starting point,

8
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:40,800
and represent it in a standard state-space form suitable for lateral control design.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,460
Let's get started. We would like to extend our kinematic bicycle model

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,310
to a dynamic model by relaxing the no slip condition and force for the kinematic model.

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,190
Recall that in the full dynamic bicycle model,

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,430
we maintain two components of the motion: the first

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,820
in the longitudinal direction in the direction of the heading,

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,600
and the second in the lateral direction perpendicular to the heading.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,375
Specifically, for the lateral vehicle model,

16
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,970
we are interested in modeling the rotation rate of

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,390
the vehicle based on the moments that affect the vehicle while moving.

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,890
To start modeling the lateral dynamics of the bicycle model,

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,970
the following assumptions will be made: first,

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,375
the forward longitudinal velocity is assumed constant.

21
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:30,530
This is done to decouple our lateral and longitudinal dynamic models,

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,855
which simplifies our modeling task greatly,

23
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:38,585
but does lead to modeling inaccuracies when accelerating or decelerating out of curves.

24
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:42,320
Second, as with the kinematic bicycle model,

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,030
the left and right wheels for

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,050
both front and rear axles are lumped into a single wheel each.

27
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,280
So, this assumption converts the four wheels to two wheels bicycle model.

28
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,265
Finally, other nonlinear effects such as suspension movement,

29
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:03,080
road inclination, and aerodynamic forces are assumed to be negligible.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,275
In practice, these effects can have a significant impact on the tire forces that occur.

31
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,530
So, this is again,

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,720
a limiting assumption in some cases,

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,015
but it's sufficient for our purposes.

34
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:18,560
We will use the vehicle center of gravity as the reference point for

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,065
the dynamic model as it simplifies the application of Newton's second law.

36
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:29,030
We can define the total acceleration in the inertial frame as a_y,

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,545
and this includes the lateral acceleration in the body frame y double dot,

38
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:36,785
and the centripetal acceleration from rotation of the vehicle,

39
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,980
omega squared R. These expressions can be

40
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,805
rewritten in terms of the slip angle rate of change, beta dot,

41
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,260
and the heading rate of change,

42
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,510
psi dot using the definition of the slip angle and the fact that V equals omega R,

43
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,150
and omega is equal to psi dot respectively.

44
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,440
The model formulation for lateral dynamics can now be formed with the only two

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,780
forces affecting the dynamics being the lateral forces on the front and rear tires.

46
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,640
The vehicle longitudinal velocity is defined by V as before and

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,885
the mass is m. For the angular accelerations, psi double dot,

48
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:18,815
the moments produced by the tire forces act in

49
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,265
opposite directions and combine with the inertial term,

50
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:26,830
I_z times psi double dot to form this second-order equation.

51
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,440
The parameters, L_f and L_r define the distances to each tire from the cg.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,960
One of the most important components in vehicle dynamics modeling or the tires.

53
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,425
Tire forces are generally hard to predict exactly,

54
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:46,670
and tire models tend to be nonlinear and empirically identified.

55
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,380
We'll explore some of

56
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,110
the more common tire models in detail in the final video in this module.

57
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,324
Fortunately however, for normal driving conditions,

58
00:03:56,324 --> 00:04:01,085
a simple linear approximation can be used to model tire force generation.

59
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:05,155
This approximation is really only valid for small slip angles,

60
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:10,160
and the tire forces are modeled as varying linearly with slip angles specifically.

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,690
As we use the linear tire model in our control design,

62
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,800
we must make sure to not exceed

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,035
this small angle assumption by sticking to non-aggressive driving maneuvers.

64
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:23,900
In order to use these linear tire models,

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,430
we need to define the front and rear side slip angles,

66
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,710
alpha f and alpha r. They are defined

67
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,325
in exactly the same way as the vehicle slip angle beta,

68
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:36,950
but are defined relative to the direction of

69
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,370
the wheel and the vehicle velocity at the wheel center.

70
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,800
The cornering stiffness of a tire is defined by

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,850
its ability to resist deformation while the vehicle corners.

72
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,400
This diagram shows the relationship between

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,035
the lateral tire force and the tire slip angle.

74
00:04:56,035 --> 00:05:01,700
The slope of the line at zero is known as the cornering stiffness coefficients, C_y.

75
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,405
As can be seen in the plot for small slip angles,

76
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,410
typically less than eight degrees,

77
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,105
the relation is almost a linear relation.

78
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:15,170
We can introduce C_f and C_r as linearized

79
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,280
cornering stiffness of the front and rear wheels for the bicycle model.

80
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,240
Therefore, the relation between the lateral forces acting on

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,004
the front and rear wheels will be the product of the cornering stiffness,

82
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,940
C_y, and the slip angle,

83
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,680
alpha for each tire.

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,930
We can rewrite the tire slip angles in terms of the vehicle slip angle beta,

85
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,805
the steering angle delta,

86
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,935
the longitudinal velocity V,

87
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,495
and the yaw rate.

88
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:46,040
The previously derived dynamic equations for the lateral bicycle model can

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,005
now be modified by substituting in the tire force slip equations.

90
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,780
This leads to the following pair of

91
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,510
coupled ordinary differential equations that

92
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,035
govern the dynamics of the vehicle in the lateral direction.

93
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,920
Note that the left-hand side variables represent the rate of change of

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,915
the vehicle slip angle and the rate of change of the yaw rate.

95
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:10,160
Conveniently and because of

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,610
the approximations and assumptions made throughout this derivation,

97
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,420
the resulting dynamic lateral vehicle model is linear.

98
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,665
We can define a state vector,

99
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:22,980
X_lat that includes the lateral position;

100
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,620
y, the slip angle; beta,

101
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,435
the yaw angle; psi,

102
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,730
and the yaw rates; psi dot.

103
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:35,119
The system can now be expressed in standard state-space form as follows;

104
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,495
X dot lat equals A_lat times,

105
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:41,630
X_lat, plus B_lat times delta.

106
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,565
The system dynamics matrices are A_lat and B_lat

107
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:49,835
which are time-invariant if the forward speed V is kept constant.

108
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:54,760
The main input to the system is the driver steering angle command, delta.

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,820
This state space representation is very useful when we are designing

110
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,340
different control strategies such as PID or MPC for lateral control.

111
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,740
The linearity of this model also makes it

112
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,650
suitable for state estimation with Kalman filters,

113
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,545
which you'll learn more about in course two.

114
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:15,020
Let's summarize this video.

115
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,030
We first learned how to extend

116
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,370
our kinematic bicycle model to become a dynamic bicycle model,

117
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,440
and then we derived a lateral dynamics of

118
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,740
the bicycle model and expressed it in state space form.

119
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,820
In the next video,

120
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,330
we'll explore and build models for the vehicle actuation system including a throttle,

121
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,640
break, and steering. See you there.
