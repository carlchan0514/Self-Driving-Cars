00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,180
Hello and welcome to this video on tire slip and modeling.

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,380
In this video, we will explore the concepts of the slip angle and slip

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,575
ratio and introduce some well-known tire models to complete our dynamic vehicle models.

4
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,310
In the previous video,

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,945
we saw how to model the steering, throttle,

6
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,700
and brake systems from

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,715
human or autonomous command to wheel angle and drive break torques.

8
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:43,505
These actuation models drive the state of the tire

9
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:47,045
and are therefore the inputs to the tire model we will develop.

10
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:50,870
A tire is the interface between the vehicle and the road,

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,930
and the external forces that are exerted on the vehicle are

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,470
entirely defined by the tire's abilities to generate them.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,515
So, to analyze the vehicle dynamics fully

14
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:03,565
and develop controllers based on dynamic models,

15
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:07,250
it is really important to have a good tire model to capture

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,765
the force-generating behavior of the tire throughout its operating range.

17
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:15,160
Let's remind ourselves of two important definitions,

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,055
the slip angle and the slip ratio.

19
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:21,730
The slip angle is the angle between the forward direction

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,345
of the vehicle in the actual direction of its motion,

21
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:28,220
which we denote Beta.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,600
The vehicle slip angle can be represented as the inverse tan of the lateral velocity,

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,650
V_y divided by the longitudinal velocity, V_x.

24
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,510
For small slip angles,

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,690
we can use the small angle approximation and

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,500
determine the slip angle Beta as the ratio between the lateral velocity,

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,310
V_y and the longitudinal velocity, V_x directly.

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,560
We can expand the slip angle concept and define the slip angle for each tire.

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,485
Here, the tire slip angles for the front and rear wheels

30
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:04,520
are defined as Alpha F and Alpha R respectively.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,690
Tire slip angles are the angle between the direction in which the wheel

32
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,680
is pointing and the direction in which it is actually traveling,

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,975
analogous to the vehicle slip angle.

34
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:20,660
The tire slip angles play an important part in defining the complete tire model.

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,790
We can relate the tire slip angles to the vehicle slip angles, the velocity,

36
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,390
and the yaw rate where the distance between the vehicle center of

37
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,845
mass and front and rear tires are represented by L_f and L_r respectively.

38
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:39,010
The other important definition needed when describing

39
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,045
tire slip is the longitudinal slip or slip ratio.

40
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:46,120
The slip ratio captures the relationship between

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,645
the deformation of the tire and the longitudinal forces acting upon it.

42
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:53,000
When accelerating or breaking,

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
the observed angular velocity of the tire does not

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,330
match the expected velocity for the pure rolling motion,

45
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,320
which means there is sliding between the tire and the road in addition to rolling.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,020
The difference between the rotation speed of the tire and the longitudinal speed of

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,820
the car can be expressed as a ratio relative to the pure rolling speed,

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,530
and it's called the slip ratio.

49
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,290
There are three cases of differences between

50
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,950
the vehicle velocity and the angular tire velocity.

51
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,430
First, when the vehicle velocity, v,

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,950
is greater than the tire velocity, r,

53
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,430
times w. In this case,

54
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,910
the wheels are skidding.

55
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,300
This happens during deceleration of the vehicle.

56
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,700
Second, when the vehicle velocity,

57
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,895
v is less than the tire velocity, R_w.

58
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,610
In this case, the wheels are spinning.

59
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,595
This happens often in low friction driving on icy roads or when drifting of course.

60
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:58,355
Third, when the tire velocity is zero and the vehicle velocity is non-zero.

61
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,940
In this case, the wheels are locked.

62
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,140
This is an extension of our first case and can occur during emergency braking.

63
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,130
However, modern anti-lock braking systems seek to avoid

64
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,935
this regime due to its poor stopping performance and loss of steering control.

65
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:18,140
So, let's look at some modeling methods for how

66
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,485
the tire generates forces throughout its operating range.

67
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:25,385
The tire model takes as inputs the vehicle slip angle,

68
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:29,210
the tire ratio, the road coefficient of friction,

69
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,110
and the normal force in the vertical direction acting on the tire.

70
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,925
It then computes forces in the lateral and longitudinal directions.

71
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:42,020
Additional inputs can bring improved accuracy of course,

72
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,435
such as tire material properties,

73
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:45,875
and the camber angle;

74
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,130
the angle between the tire rotation plane and the road.

75
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,630
These additional inputs can help expand the set of forces and moments that can be

76
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,630
modeled to include the self alignment moment or the moment about the steering axis,

77
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,875
that's self aligns a tire with the direction of travel,

78
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,365
the rolling resistance moment,

79
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,465
and even an overturning moment.

80
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:12,095
Tire modeling is a deep and well-established field

81
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,780
and many different kinds of models have been developed.

82
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,585
We can categorize these models into three main modeling approaches: analytical,

83
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:23,945
numerical, and parameterized models.

84
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:26,750
Analytical models are models that have been

85
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,695
defined from physics-based modeling of the tire,

86
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:35,180
which normally leads to simple and fast models that are suitable for control development.

87
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,370
Although appealing from a computational perspective,

88
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,640
these models don't often perform well over the full operating range of the tire.

89
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,305
The Brush and Fiala models are some examples from this group.

90
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:52,550
Numerical models come from the detailed solution of

91
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,270
finite difference and finite element multidimensional models

92
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,095
of a tire and are represented as a set of tables.

93
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:03,440
These models are more accurate than the previous group,

94
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,725
but difficult to use for model-based control development.

95
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:09,995
Many simulators use numerical models

96
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,420
to improve the fidelity of their vehicle dynamics however,

97
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,400
allowing for accurate assessment of stability and

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,940
traction control systems prior to deployment.

99
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,315
Parameterized models are models that define

100
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:26,765
a tire curve family through a parameterized function.

101
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,600
The function parameters are then identified through

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,815
extensive measurement and each tire must be assessed separately.

103
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:36,965
Famous parameterized models such as the Linear,

104
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:41,835
Pacejka and Dugoff models are used extensively in vehicle dynamic modeling

105
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:47,660
as they offer a combination of accurate force prediction and convenient computation.

106
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,760
These models can be easily

107
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,300
implemented and are suitable for model-based control development.

108
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,770
Let's now look at two parameterized models in a bit more detail.

109
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,055
We'll start with the simple linear tire model.

110
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:06,425
The Linear model has two parts represented by a piecewise linear curve.

111
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:12,290
The first part corresponds to the linear tire region which relates the tire force,

112
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,315
either longitudinal or lateral,

113
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:19,400
directly to the tire slip ratio or slip angle through a force coefficient,

114
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,975
C. The second part corresponds to the saturation region where the tire exerts

115
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:29,260
a constant maximum tire force for all

116
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,380
slip ratios or angles above the maximum slip ratio or angle.

117
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,320
The maximum slip ratio, S max,

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,220
leads to a maximum longitudinal tire force,

119
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,385
F_x max, and the maximum slip angle,

120
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:47,495
Alpha max, leads to a maximum lateral tire force, F_y max.

121
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,110
In general, the Linear tire model is

122
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,010
a good approximation for a significant portion of the linear region,

123
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,790
but drops in accuracy as we enter saturation.

124
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,400
For nominal self-driving however,

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,860
linear models are a good approximation

126
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,605
since the tire mostly operates in the linear region.

127
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:09,770
The second model we'll look at is one of

128
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,890
the most important and most widely used tire models

129
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,755
in vehicle dynamics in model-based control.

130
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:19,460
It is called the Pacejka tire model and is also called

131
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,770
the magic formula because of how well it represents longitudinal and lateral tire forces.

132
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,830
So, here is the magic formula to calculate

133
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,815
the longitudinal tire force as a function of the slip ratio,

134
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,560
the tire normal force,

135
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,050
and the road coefficient of friction.

136
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,280
We define system parameters B, C, D,

137
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,290
and E from experiments,

138
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,290
and these will differ from one tire to another.

139
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,330
The typical longitudinal tire force versus

140
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,355
longitudinal slip at different road friction coefficients is shown in the figure.

141
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:57,635
Finally, let's look at some data collected from tire road testing.

142
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:01,730
The following plots show the normalized longitudinal tire force on

143
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,750
the left and the normalized lateral tire force on the right,

144
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,540
plotted with respect to their slip ratio and slip angle respectively.

145
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,230
Overlaid on top of

146
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,030
the experimental data points are the linear model and the Pacejka model.

147
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,925
We can see that both models are good representations of the data in the low slip regions,

148
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:27,110
but that the linear model does poorly as the slip increases.

149
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,370
This data also gives us a good idea of the difficulty of modeling tire forces

150
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:38,775
exactly as the spread in the measured forces is quite pronounced relative to the models.

151
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:42,350
Nonetheless, both models are extremely useful for

152
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,590
creating simulated vehicles whose dynamics can be computed

153
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,740
efficiently and for developing control laws

154
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,430
based on the dynamic models of the vehicle and its many subsystems.

155
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,880
In this video, we looked at one of

156
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,490
the most important components in vehicle dynamics modeling; the tire model.

157
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,150
We revisited the definitions of tire slip and tire ratio and

158
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,220
explored different tire models that produce

159
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,510
force estimates based on the characteristics of the tire.

160
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,250
Congratulations, you've made it to the end of

161
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,495
the third module in our introduction to self-driving cars course.

162
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:23,915
In this module, you developed your skills in kinematic and dynamic modeling of vehicles.

163
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,485
You derived the kinematic bicycle model of a car.

164
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:32,285
You explored lateral and longitudinal dynamic modeling of vehicles.

165
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,740
In the next module,

166
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,740
we will use these detailed vehicle models to design

167
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,270
controllers that regulate longitudinal vehicle motion. See you then.
