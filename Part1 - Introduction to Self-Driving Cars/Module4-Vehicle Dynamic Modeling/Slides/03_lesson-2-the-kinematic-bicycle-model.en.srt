00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,795
Welcome back. In the last video,

2
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:19,520
we discussed the basics of kinematic modeling and

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,955
constraints and introduced the notion of the instantaneous center of rotation.

4
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:29,060
In this lesson, we will develop the kinematic bicycle model,

5
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,760
a classic model that does surprisingly well at

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,670
capturing vehicle motion in normal driving conditions.

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:41,240
Let's get started. The well-known kinematic bicycle model has long been used as

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,500
a suitable control-oriented model for representing vehicles because of

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,425
its simplicity and adherence to the nonholonomic constraints of a car.

10
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,375
Before we derive the model,

11
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,620
let's define some additional variables on

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,905
top of the ones we used for the two-wheeled robot.

13
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,320
The bicycle model we'll develop is called the front wheel steering model,

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,085
as the front wheel orientation can be controlled relative to the heading of the vehicle.

15
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:10,520
Once again, we assume the vehicle operates on

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,645
a 2D plane denoted by the inertial frame FI.

17
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:17,185
In the proposed bicycle model,

18
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:21,230
the front wheel represents the front right and left wheels of the car,

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,850
and the rear wheel represents the rear right and left wheels of the car.

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,180
To analyze the kinematics of the bicycle model,

21
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,750
we must select a reference point X,

22
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,415
Y on the vehicle which can be placed at the center of the rear axle,

23
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,980
the center of the front axle,

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,480
or at the center of gravity or cg.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,380
The selection of the reference point changes the kinematic equations that result,

26
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,310
which in turn change the controller designs that we'll use.

27
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,110
As needed, we'll switch between reference points throughout this course.

28
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,145
Let's start with the rear axle reference point model.

29
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:05,585
We'll denote the location of the rear axle reference point as xr,

30
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,645
yr and the heading of the bicycle as Theta.

31
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:11,150
We'll use L for the length of the bicycle,

32
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,880
measured between the two wheel axes.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,950
As with the two-wheeled robot,

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,635
these are our main model states.

35
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:21,290
The inputs for the bicycle model are

36
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,930
slightly different than those for the two-wheeled robot,

37
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,895
as we now need to define a steering angle for the front wheel.

38
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:31,040
Let this steering angle be denoted by Delta,

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,285
and is measured relative to the forward direction of the bicycle.

40
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:40,685
The velocity is denoted v and points in the same direction as each wheel.

41
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:44,865
This is an assumption referred to as the no slip condition,

42
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:50,345
which requires that our wheel cannot move laterally or slip longitudinally either.

43
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:53,900
It is the same assumption that allows us to compute

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,605
the forward speed of the two-wheeled robot based on the rotation rates of its wheels.

45
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:01,935
Because of the no slip condition,

46
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,050
we once again have that Omega,

47
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,935
the rotation rate of the bicycle,

48
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:10,400
is equal to the velocity over the instantaneous center of rotation,

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,785
radius R. From the similar triangles formed by L and R,

50
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:17,420
and v and Delta,

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,130
we see that the tan of Delta is equal to the wheelbase L

52
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,250
over the instantaneous turn radius R. By combining both equations,

53
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,595
we can find the relation between the rotation rate of the vehicle Omega,

54
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,545
and the steering angle Delta,

55
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,530
as Omega equals v tan Delta over

56
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,650
L. We can now form

57
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,345
the complete kinematic bicycle model for the rear axle reference point.

58
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:46,865
Based on this model configuration,

59
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:51,590
the velocity components of the reference point in the x and y direction are

60
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,440
equal to the forward velocity v times cos Theta and sine Theta respectively.

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,310
These two equations are combined with the equation for rotation rate

62
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,930
derived previously to form the rear axle bicycle model.

63
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,160
The bicycle kinematic model can be reformulated when the center

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,195
of the front axle is taken as the reference point x, y.

65
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:18,800
This is a good exercise to try yourself to practice applying the principles of

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,040
instantaneous center of rotation and follow the rear axle derivation quite closely.

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,300
The velocity points in the direction of the front wheel this time,

68
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,510
which is defined by the summation of Delta and Theta.

69
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,630
Working through the derivation leads to the following kinematic model for the vehicle.

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,330
The last scenario is when the desired point is placed at

71
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,070
the center of gravity or center of mass as shown in the right-hand figure.

72
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,235
Because of the no slip constraints we enforce on the front and rear wheels,

73
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:58,070
the direction of motion at the cg is slightly different from

74
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,305
the forward velocity direction in either wheel and from the heading of the bicycle.

75
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:07,420
This difference is called the slip angle or side slip angle,

76
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,615
which we'll refer to as Beta,

77
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:12,590
and is measured as the angular difference between

78
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,460
the velocity at the cg and the heading of the bicycle.

79
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,910
This definition of side slip angle will also

80
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,119
apply when we move to dynamic modeling of vehicles,

81
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:26,040
where it can become more pronounced.

82
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,830
The kinematic model with the reference point at the cg can be derived

83
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,090
similarly to both the rear and forward axle reference point models.

84
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,585
We end up with the following formulation,

85
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:43,560
which we'll use as the basis for our modeling of the dynamics of vehicles as well.

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,985
Lastly, because of the no slip condition,

87
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:51,110
we can compute the slip angle from the geometry of our bicycle model.

88
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,780
Given LR, the distance from the rear wheel to the cg,

89
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:03,690
the slip angle Beta is equal to the ratio of LR over L times tan Delta.

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,480
Finally, it is not usually possible to instantaneously

91
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,250
change the steering angle of a vehicle from one extreme of its range to another,

92
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,415
as is currently possible with our kinematic model.

93
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:20,285
Since Delta is an input that would be selected by a controller,

94
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:24,980
there is no restriction on how quickly it can change which is somewhat unrealistic.

95
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,615
Instead, our kinematic models can be formulated with four states: x,

96
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,415
y, Theta, and the steering angle Delta.

97
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:39,200
If we assume we can only control the rate of change of the steering angle Phi,

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,190
we can simply extend our model to include Delta as

99
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,965
a state and use the steering rate Phi as our modified input.

100
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:51,670
Our kinematic bicycle model is now complete.

101
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,790
Once again, we'll use a state-based representation of the model for

102
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,370
control purposes later in this course

103
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,805
and throughout the second course on state estimation as well.

104
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:07,610
Our kinematic bicycle model takes as inputs the velocity and the steering rate Phi.

105
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,275
The state of the system,

106
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,494
including the positions XC,

107
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,180
YC, the orientation Theta,

108
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,025
and the steering angle Delta,

109
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:19,685
evolve according to our kinematic equations from the model,

110
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:22,340
which satisfy the no slip condition.

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,680
We can now use this model to design

112
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,620
kinematic steering controllers as we'll see in a later module in this course.

113
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,810
To summarize this video,

114
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,940
we formulated the kinematic model of a bicycle for

115
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,800
three different reference points on

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,765
that vehicle and Introduced the concept of slip angle.

117
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:43,640
We'll use this kinematic bicycle model throughout

118
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,750
the next two modules for designing of controllers for self-driving cars.

119
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,115
In the next video,

120
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:50,810
we'll learn about how to develop

121
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,990
dynamic vehicle models for any moving system. See you next time.
