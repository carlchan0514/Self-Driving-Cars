1
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,440
Because the industry is so new,

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,210
we at so many different challenges,

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,670
we have to find
so many different ways of

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,370
solving problems that we've
never had to solve before.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,110
So, it's great and challenging
in trying to figure

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,509
out those innovative solutions

7
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,470
to this such a hard
problem that we have.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,180
There has been a phenomenal
amount of research in

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,460
Academia and to how we

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,770
get these cars on the road
in the first place,

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,780
like how do we detect pedestrians,

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,360
how do we plan
trajectories for example.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,950
The problem that
industry needs to solve

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,500
is how do we deliver this experience
to thousands of customers,

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,130
tens of thousands of riders,

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,960
maybe someday even
millions of riders.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,690
Part of this problem is how
do we scale up our systems,

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,100
how do we deliver

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,550
the same algorithms on maps out
or the size of San Francisco,

20
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,850
the Bay Area, eventually
the continental US.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,385
This is a big problem that

22
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:14,000
is very exciting to tackle
and very exciting to solve.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,440
Of course, in any major city,

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,155
there are lots of environments
that would present

25
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:22,120
a challenge to the sensing
systems on an autonomous vehicle.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,295
For example, in San Francisco,

27
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:27,440
you have areas with really
tall buildings and that really

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,500
contributes to GPS multi-paths areas.

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,230
For example, the financial district

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,770
of San Francisco with all of
the tall buildings there.

31
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,785
There's a really big question,

32
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:40,040
the circling around
in the AV world now,

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,250
and that's how do we
say strong things about

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,650
the safety of systems that
are unbelievably complicated?

35
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,820
This is one of the hardest
engineering problems

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,085
as a species we've engaged in.

37
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:53,960
How are we gonna say strong things?

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
So, one school of thought says,

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,200
"You have to formally
verify the code."

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,980
That seems to not scale at the moment

41
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,630
with what we know about
formal verification

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,980
for the size of these systems,

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,870
and of course the difficulty is that

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,080
the inputs to our
self-driving vehicle are so

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,110
wildly various that it seems
hard to be able to write

46
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,875
down all possible inputs that
are coming into the system.

47
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,840
So, then you could say, "Well,

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,690
maybe we should just build
amazing simulators of it.

49
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,670
So, maybe we should if we
could build simulators,

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,490
then we could run 10,000 copies of

51
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,500
the autonomous vehicles
simultaneously

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,365
and get millions of miles overnight."

53
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:30,800
Well, that's very compelling as well.

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,620
But as yet, we don't have
an ability to really

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,280
simulate the detail that comes
in on some of these sensors.

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,975
So, it's very hard for example,

57
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:42,995
to simulate a full scanning radar

58
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,680
because of the complexity
of those interactions.

59
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,450
So, then you come back to
the argument that says,

60
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,795
"You just need to go and
drive and drive and drive,

61
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,220
and get miles under the wheels,

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,945
and then remember
the very interesting cases

63
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:59,600
and try and replay those back
perhaps in your simulator,

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,570
so perhaps you build up a playbook."

65
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,205
I wreck, and the answer
is all of those

66
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,500
just like I say don't
choose one sensor,

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,670
I say use all of them.

68
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,320
Why have an argument
about what the best way,

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,490
I say, "Well, if they all."

70
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,845
They all contribute in axes in

71
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:16,459
understanding how do we certify
and make our vehicles safe,

72
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,140
there's not one solution
and we shouldn't be

73
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,120
rushed to say what it is,
it's all of these things.

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,325
You need simulation, you need miles,

75
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,790
and in some places,
you might say, "Well,

76
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,250
actually this is
such a critical component

77
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,425
on the vehicle where
it starts talking to

78
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:33,920
actually the vehicle controller
that I do on some verification

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,540
of that gateway on the command

80
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,490
signals going to
the vehicle such that,

81
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,530
if the autonomy system
fails or software

82
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,249
contract to not come back
guaranteed and 50 milliseconds,

83
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,650
then I save the trigger happens
in the vehicle slows down."

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,680
So, it's all of those things
and I would say have

85
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,570
an open-mind to all of
them and don't try and

86
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,730
say it has to be done in
this one particular way.
