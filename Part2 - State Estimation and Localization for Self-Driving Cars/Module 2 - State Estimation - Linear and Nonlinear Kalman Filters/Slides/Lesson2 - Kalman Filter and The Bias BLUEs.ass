2
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.774
Now, we've introduced the Kalman Filter,

3
00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.909
let's discuss little bit about what makes
it such an appealing estimation method.

4
00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.053
By the end of this lesson,

5
00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:27.320
you'll be able to define a few terms
that are important in state estimation.

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.680
First, the concept of bias.

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.280
And second, consistency.

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.400
Finally, you'll use these definitions to
show why the Kalman Filter is the best

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Linear Unbiased Estimator, or BLUE.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.940
Let's dive in.

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.390
First, let's discuss bias.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.670
Let's consider our Kalman Filter
from the previous lesson and

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.990
use it to estimate the position
of our autonomous car.

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.520
If we have some way of knowing the true
position of the vehicle, for example,

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.160
an oracle tells us,

16
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.870
we can then use this to record a position
error of our filter at each time step k.

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.840
Since we're dealing with random noise,
doing this once is not enough.

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.440
We'll need to repeat this same
process over and over and

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.830
record our position
error at each time step.

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.860
Once we've collected these errors, if they
average to zero at a particular time step

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.200
k, then we say the Kalman Filter
estimate is unbiased at this time step.

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.370
Graphically, this is what
the situation may look like.

23
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.060
Say the particular time step, we know
that the true position is the following.

24
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.620
We build a histogram of the positions that
our filter reports over multiple trials,

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.800
and then compute the difference between
the average of these estimates and

26
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.490
the true position.

27
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.930
If this difference does not approach zero,
then our estimate is biased.

28
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.832
However, if this difference does approach
zero as we repeat this experiment

29
00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:53.450
many more times, and
if this happens for all time intervals,

30
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.834
then we say that our filter is unbiased.

31
00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:01.406
Although we could potentially verify
this lack of bias empirically,

32
00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:05.040
what we'd really like are some
theoretical guarantees.

33
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.150
Let's consider the error
dynamics of our filter.

34
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.221
Defining our predicted and corrected state
errors, we can then use the common filter

35
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:15.741
equations to write
the following relations.

36
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.943
For the Kalman Filter,

37
00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:26.150
we can show the expectation value of
these errors is equal to zero exactly.

38
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.660
For this to be true, we need to ensure
that our initial state estimate

39
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.625
is unbiased and that our noise is white,
uncorrelated, and zero mean.

40
00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.557
While this is a great result for
linear systems,

41
00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:43.350
remember that this doesn't guarantee that
our estimates will be error free for

42
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.302
a given trial, only that the expected
value of the error is zero.

43
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:52.590
Kalman Filters are also
what is called consistent.

44
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.195
By consistency we mean that for
all time steps k, the filter

45
00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:02.910
co-variants P sub k matches the expected
value of the square of our error.

46
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.580
For scalar parameters,
this means that the empirical variance

47
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.749
of our estimate should match
the variance reported by the filter.

48
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.730
Practically, this means that our
filter is neither overconfident, nor

49
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.470
underconfident in
the estimate it has produced.

50
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.370
A filter that is overconfident,
and hence inconsistent,

51
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.770
will report a covariance
that is optimistic.

52
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.000
That is, the filter will essentially place
too much emphasis on its own estimate and

53
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.010
will be less sensitive to
future measurement updates,

54
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.590
which may provide critical information.

55
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.390
It's easy to see how an overconfident
filter might have a negative or

56
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.010
dangerous effect on the performance
of self-driving car.

57
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.000
Showing the consistency property formally
is outside of the scope of the course.

58
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.320
You can take my word that it is
indeed true for a common filter.

59
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.270
So long as our initial
estimate is consistent, and

60
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.990
we have white zero mean noise,
then all estimates will be consistent.

61
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.000
Putting everything together,
we've shown that given white

62
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.780
uncorrelated zero mean noise, the Kalman
Filter is unbiased and consistent.

63
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.920
Because of these two facts,

64
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.150
we say that the Kalman Filter is the BLUE,
the best linear unbiased estimator.

65
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.025
It produces unbiased estimates with
the minimum possible variance.

66
00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:27.058
To summarize, in this lesson
we've defined the terms bias and

67
00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:32.049
consistency, and
showed that the Kalman Filter is unbiased,

68
00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:37.246
consistent, and the Best Linear
Unbiased Estimator, or BLUE.

69
00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:42.127
Remember that best here refers to
the fact that the Kalman Filter minimizes

70
00:04:42.127 --> 00:04:43.527
the state variance.

71
00:04:43.527 --> 00:04:48.738
Although this is a fantastic result,
most real systems are not linear.

72
00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:53.272
For self-driving cars, we'll
generally need to estimate non-linear

73
00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:58.038
quantities like vehicle poses,
position, and orientation in 2D and 3D.

74
00:04:58.038 --> 00:04:58.789
To do this,

75
00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.682
we'll need to extend the linear
Kalman Filter into the non-linear domain.

76
00:05:03.682 --> 00:05:05.030
We'll do this in the next lesson.

77
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:15.030
