00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.460
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.500
we'll talk about
a particular type of sensor

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.945
that most of you will
be very familiar with,

4
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:26.805
the Global Navigation Satellite
Systems or GNSS receiver.

5
00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:28.980
We'll learn about why
this navigation sensor

6
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.290
is so important for a self-driving car.

7
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.810
It's able to provide a
position fix anywhere in

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.720
the world with bounded
error which is key.

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.355
Specifically, we'll
develop a model for GNSS

10
00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:44.120
based on the principles of
pseudoranging and trilateration.

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.900
We'll then familiarize ourselves
with sources of GNSS positioning

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.600
error and talk about some ways
to improve one type of GNSS.

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.900
Just like the IMU discussed
in a previous lecture,

14
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.595
nearly every modern smartphone has
at least one type of GNSS receiver.

15
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.175
Although we take them for granted now,

16
00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:07.405
the first modern system of
global positioning satellites,

17
00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:12.155
GPS, was built for military
use during the 1980s.

18
00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:17.255
By the time the second version of the
system was fully operational in 1995,

19
00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:20.705
GPS was made available
to the public for free.

20
00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.350
This was in part due to
the highly publicized crash of

21
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.885
Korean Airlines flight 007 in 1983.

22
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:33.500
Flight 007 was a 747
passenger jet that flew

23
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.765
from New York City to Seoul with
refueling stop in Anchorage Alaska.

24
00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.130
As it flew from Anchorage to Seoul,

25
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.790
it deviated from its plan flight path
and was shot down by

26
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.570
a fighter jet after spending
several hours in Soviet airspace.

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.315
To cross the North Pacific Ocean,

28
00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:56.435
Flight 007 relied on an inertial
navigation system for guidance.

29
00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:00.215
The pilots, failing to properly
initialize the system,

30
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.285
mistakenly maintained the aircraft
on a specific magnetic heading.

31
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.860
In turn, the plane deviated by

32
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.415
more than 300 kilometers
from its planned course.

33
00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:14.090
Shortly after Flight 007 was shot down,

34
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.210
then President Ronald Reagan
issued a directive to allow

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.880
the US Global Positioning System to

36
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.450
be freely available to the public
once it was fully developed.

37
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.210
Although GPS was the original system of

38
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.645
navigation satellites used for
global positioning, today,

39
00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:33.080
the term global navigation
satellite system is used as a

40
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.490
catch-all for several such satellite
constellations that exist.

41
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.300
The two that are fully
operational as of 2018 are

42
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.185
GPS and GLONASS, the Russian equivalent.

43
00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.450
Several other systems
are nearing completion

44
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.305
including the European
Galileo constellation.

45
00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:53.625
For this video, we'll
look at GPS more closely,

46
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:57.695
though other GNSS systems
operate on similar principles.

47
00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:00.590
The GPS constellation is composed of

48
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.760
24-32 satellites that are
in six orbital planes.

49
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.405
Satellites are decommissioned
and replaced periodically.

50
00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:12.679
Each satellite isn't a medium Earth
orbit an altitude of roughly 20,000

51
00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:17.165
kilometers with an orbital period
of just under 12 hours.

52
00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:21.020
The constellation is designed such
that at least four satellites are

53
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.370
visible at any surface point
on earth at all times.

54
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.740
Each satellite broadcasts
on two frequencies,

55
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.750
one for civilian and
one for military use.

56
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.740
Each broadcast signal contains
a pseudo-random code that

57
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.510
identifies the satellite position and

58
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.270
the time of transmission of the signal.

59
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.250
The basic principle behind GPS
is time of arrival ranging.

60
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.210
The receiver computes a distance
to each visible satellite by

61
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.830
comparing its own internal clock with
that of the time of transmission.

62
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.430
The time difference is converted
to a distance using knowledge that

63
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.285
electromagnetic signals
propagate at the speed of light.

64
00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:03.940
To compute a 3D position,

65
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.610
the ranging equations require
at least four visible satellites.

66
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.270
If altitude is known and
only a 2D position is required,

67
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.475
only three satellites are needed.

68
00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.120
The process of recovering position
from several distances to

69
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.120
known landmarks is called trilateration.

70
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.010
Note that this is different
from triangulation where

71
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.860
we compute positions based
off of angle measurements.

72
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.920
A GPS receiver measures the pseudorange
to each satellite using

73
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.185
the following measurement model:

74
00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:39.395
The model accounts for
receiver clock error,

75
00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:43.100
atmospheric propagation delays,
and measurement noise.

76
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.710
The term pseudorange
refers to the fact that

77
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.860
the range information is corrupted
by the error sources above.

78
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.665
Each pseudorange measurement defines
a circle in 2D or a sphere in 3D.

79
00:04:56.665 --> 00:04:59.245
If we have exactly four satellites,

80
00:04:59.245 --> 00:05:01.150
we can solve for
the receiver position and

81
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.775
the receiver clock error explicitly.

82
00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:05.880
If we have more than four,

83
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.410
we can use the method of
least squares to find

84
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.680
the maximum likelihood position
assuming Gaussian noise.

85
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.600
GPS suffers from multiple error sources.

86
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.700
First, charged ions in

87
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.480
the ionosphere can delay
the signal by an unknown amount.

88
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.080
Surrounding terrain and buildings
may cause reflections that

89
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.895
increase the distance traveled by
the signal before reaching the receiver,

90
00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:32.790
these are called multi-path errors.

91
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.020
Any small error in
clock synchronization or

92
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.745
satellite position information can
have catastrophic consequences.

93
00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:43.910
Even a one microsecond
timing error can lead to

94
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.865
a significant error in
position, 300 meters.

95
00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:50.450
Both a Ephemeris data
and satellite clocks

96
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.550
are updated and recalibrated often,

97
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.300
but the calibration can be out of date.

98
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.340
Finally, the geometric configuration of

99
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.645
visible satellites can also lead to
variations in positioning accuracy.

100
00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:05.975
This is known as the geometric
dilution of precision.

101
00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:08.930
For higher accuracy, a configuration with

102
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.055
satellites spread across
the sky is preferable.

103
00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:15.800
Luckily, for some applications,

104
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.110
we can improve GNSS accuracy by
augmenting the system in various ways.

105
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.180
Differential GPS can correct

106
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.550
receiver positioning
estimates by making use of

107
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.830
the more accurately known positions
of one or more fixed base stations.

108
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.950
Corrections are broadcast
on separate frequencies to

109
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.595
the GNSS receiver in the moving vehicle.

110
00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:42.170
Real-Time Kinematic, or
RTK GPS makes use of

111
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.090
carrier phase information to improve

112
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.440
positioning accuracy down to
two centimeters in some cases.

113
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.780
Although both of these techniques can

114
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.374
significantly improve
the accuracy of GPS,

115
00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:56.260
they're typically quite
costly to implement.

116
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.825
As we mentioned in the previous video,

117
00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:01.550
inertial sensors are very
useful for navigation.

118
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.840
However, they drift or accumulate
unbounded error over time.

119
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.150
The GPS system in contrast,

120
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.930
provides bounded error
positioning updates.

121
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.685
A self-driving car equipped
with GPS will maintain

122
00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:17.570
a guaranteed level of positioning
accuracy at all times,

123
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.280
unless the GPS receiver fails or loses
track of at least four satellites.

124
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.965
So to summarize this video,

125
00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.430
Global Navigation Satellite
Systems work by combining

126
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.835
pseudoranges from at least four
satellites to determine a 3D position.

127
00:07:33.835 --> 00:07:37.220
GPS or GNSS error can come from

128
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.160
several different sources
including ionospheric delays,

129
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.440
multi-path effects, and also

130
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.130
possibly from the geometric
dilution of precision.

131
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.745
To improve GNSS accuracy,

132
00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:52.530
techniques like differential GPS
or RTK GPS can be used.

133
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.815
That's the end of this module.

134
00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:57.320
In module four, we'll describe how we

135
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.170
confuse inertial
measurements from IMUs with

136
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.855
position measurements
from a GPS to produce

137
00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:05.825
an accurate localization estimate
for a self-driving car.

138
00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:07.910
The sensors are complementary
and they're used

139
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.310
together in practically
all self-driving cars.

140
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.640
See you in the next module.
