2
00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:18.902
In this lesson we are going to discuss
the Inertial Measurement Unit or IMU.

3
00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:23.237
By the end of this lesson you will be able
to describe the operating principles of

4
00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:27.524
the two sensors that make up the basic
IMU, an Accelerometer and a Gyroscope.

5
00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:30.946
You will also be able to model each
of these sensors, and account for

6
00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:33.560
things like sensor noise and bias.

7
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.145
This will be crucial when we incorporate
an IMU into a full-state estimator.

8
00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.862
Let's begin.

9
00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:42.148
The inertial measurement unit, or

10
00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.662
IMU measures the movement of
a body in inertial space.

11
00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:49.594
Today a certain type of cheap,
mass manufactured IMU,

12
00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:54.794
is found in nearly every smartphone,
such as the iPhone X pictured here.

13
00:00:54.794 --> 00:00:59.368
IMUs are often used tasks including,
step counting for health tracking,

14
00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:02.429
and more recently as
augmented reality devices.

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.891
Despite their ubiquity today,

16
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:09.648
the development of a sensor that
could accurately track the motion

17
00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:13.622
of a moving body was a significant
achievement of the 20th century.

18
00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:19.451
The IMU aided transoceanic flights long
before GPS, and was crucial to the Apollo

19
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:25.041
missions as part of the on board guidance,
navigation, and control system.

20
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:30.125
The Apollo spacecraft relied on an IMU
to accurately track both the position,

21
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:34.141
and orientation of the vehicle
on the long voyage to the moon.

22
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:38.413
In space there are few landmarks
to rely on for guidance.

23
00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:42.490
One can track the fixed stars but
this is not easy.

24
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.987
The onboard IMU which
operated without the need for

25
00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:50.468
such landmarks Enabled safe
navigation to the Moon's surface.

26
00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:54.292
In modern self-driving cars,
IMUs play a very similar role.

27
00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:59.284
Filling in during periods when navigation
information from other sensors is

28
00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:01.671
either unavailable or unreliable.

29
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:03.341
So what is an IMU?

30
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:08.287
Well, generally, an inertial measurement
unit is a composite sensor suite

31
00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:10.569
that combines three gyroscopes and

32
00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.380
three accelerometers to track the exterior
free movement of a rigid body.

33
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.991
Some IMUs also incorporate magnetometers,
or a compass, to help track orientation.

34
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:24.330
IMUs come in many shapes and forms.

35
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.786
The sensors found in modern
smartphones are relatively cheap,

36
00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:31.122
often costing less than a few
dollars when purchased in bulk.

37
00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:34.613
They are lightweight and
require relatively little power but

38
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.701
produce quite noisy measurements.

39
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:40.350
More expensive IMUs use more complex
components and have more accurate

40
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.608
calibration models that can remove the
effects of temperature fluctuations, for

41
00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:45.171
example.

42
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.194
Let's discuss the components of an IMU.

43
00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:52.104
The gyroscopes and
the accelerometers in more detail.

44
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.402
The gyroscope has a long history.

45
00:02:56.402 --> 00:03:01.596
The term gyroscope can be quite confusing,
because it refers to several concepts

46
00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:06.503
all relating to the idea of measuring
orientation or change in orientation.

47
00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:13.960
The word itself comes from the Greek words
Guros, for circle, and skopeo, to look.

48
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.484
Historically, a gyroscope was
a spinning disk that due to its

49
00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:22.402
angular momentum resisted
changes in orientation.

50
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:27.075
In the late 19th and early 20th century,
engineers realized that this

51
00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:31.525
spinning wheel could be used as
an orientation reference for marine and

52
00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:33.393
aeronautical navigations.

53
00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.647
This required precise machining,
and instead of gimbals,

54
00:03:36.647 --> 00:03:39.276
it used high quality jewel or
numeric bearings.

55
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:45.165
Although this type of spinning disc
gyroscope can be very accurate,

56
00:03:45.165 --> 00:03:49.271
it's quite heavy, bulky and
often very expensive to manufacture.

57
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.281
Nevertheless, it is still
using aeronautics and

58
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:58.638
in ballistic applications and
can spin it up to 24,000 RPM.

59
00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:02.372
In a modern gyroscope, the spinning
wheel is typically replaced by

60
00:04:02.372 --> 00:04:06.697
a microelectromechanical system that
consists of a small silicon tuning fork

61
00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:10.564
that changes its resonance properties
based on an applied rotation or

62
00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:11.825
orientation change.

63
00:04:13.703 --> 00:04:17.602
These sensors are much cheaper and
can fit in a tiny package.

64
00:04:17.602 --> 00:04:19.682
However, they produce
noisy measurements and

65
00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:21.973
are sensitive to temperature
based fluctuations.

66
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.925
What's more, they measure rotation rates,
and not orientation directly, and so

67
00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:33.194
the output signal must be numerically
integrated to determine orientation

68
00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:33.741
change.

69
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:37.117
This process can introduce additional
errors into the final orientation

70
00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:37.668
estimate.

71
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.596
A self driving car engineer should
be aware need to account for

72
00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:48.056
issues such as drift and performance
variation with temperature introduces

73
00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:52.121
substantial additional complexity
in the sensor modeling process.

74
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:56.387
One would normally think that a spinning
mechanical device would be inferior to

75
00:04:56.387 --> 00:04:59.201
a silicon component but
this is not always the case.

76
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.411
An accelerometer measures
acceleration along a single axis.

77
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.884
Cheaper MEMS based accelerometers
use a miniature cantilever beam with

78
00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:11.652
a proof mass attached to it.

79
00:05:11.652 --> 00:05:14.932
When the sensor is accelerated,
the beam deflects.

80
00:05:14.932 --> 00:05:19.762
This deflection can be measured through
a capacitive circuit for example, and

81
00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:22.223
converted into an acceleration value.

82
00:05:22.223 --> 00:05:25.819
More expensive sensors may also
use Piezoelectric materials.

83
00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:30.825
It's important to note that
an accelerometer measures

84
00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:34.241
what's called proper acceleration,
or specific force.

85
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:38.282
This is the total non-gravitational
force per unit mass.

86
00:05:38.282 --> 00:05:42.362
The proper acceleration is
acceleration with respect to

87
00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:44.661
a reference frame in free fall.

88
00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:49.076
When you're sitting in your chair,
stationary relative to the ground,

89
00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:53.346
the proper acceleration you feel will
be the value of the gravitational

90
00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:56.212
acceleration at your location,
but upwards.

91
00:05:56.212 --> 00:06:00.770
Another way to say this is that the only
non gravitational force acting on you,

92
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.097
the normal force,
must be equal to the force of gravity.

93
00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:08.483
However, of course, for
navigational purposes,

94
00:06:08.483 --> 00:06:11.111
we often don't care about
our proper acceleration.

95
00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:15.186
What we care about is acceleration with
respect to some fixed reference frame.

96
00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:20.858
To compute this acceleration, we need
to use the fundamental equation for

97
00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:22.973
accelerometers in a gravity field.

98
00:06:22.973 --> 00:06:27.166
The second derivative opposition,
computed in a fixed frame,

99
00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:31.842
is the sum of the specific force,
and the acceleration due to gravity.

100
00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:34.472
Sometimes this could be sum up and
intuitive concept.

101
00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:41.805
So let's explore it here An accelerometer
in a stationary car measure g upwards,

102
00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:47.533
because the coordinate acceleration is
zero, ignoring the rotation of the Earth.

103
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:52.403
Since the force of gravity acts downwards
its negative is the scalar constant g

104
00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:54.042
in the upward direction.

105
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.621
Let's look at an example of this on
the International Space Station or ISS.

106
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:04.923
Is the value of g less in low Earth orbit?

107
00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:06.010
Well, it is, but

108
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.582
only by about 10% when compared to
the value on the surface of the Earth.

109
00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:15.063
The reason why we often hear the term
0 g is because the entire ISS is in

110
00:07:15.063 --> 00:07:18.401
free fall together with
the astronauts inside it.

111
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.580
An accelerometer rigidly attached to
the station will have a coordinate

112
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.223
acceleration equal to g.

113
00:07:26.223 --> 00:07:30.202
This means that the specific force
measured by an accelerometer will be 0.

114
00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:36.806
Another way of saying this is that the
proper acceleration with respect to free

115
00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:37.493
fall is 0.

116
00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:40.122
The ISS is in free fall.

117
00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:45.217
In reality residual atmospheric drag and
structural vibrations will create some

118
00:07:45.217 --> 00:07:50.106
measured accelerations but they
are typically as low as 10 to the -6 g's.

119
00:07:51.582 --> 00:07:54.536
Now, that we know about the basic
principles of gyroscopes and

120
00:07:54.536 --> 00:07:57.266
accelerometers, let's discuss
the measurement models

121
00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:00.678
we'll need to know in order to
incorporate them into a state estimator.

122
00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:04.423
[SOUND] Using the notation we
discussed in the previous lesson,

123
00:08:04.423 --> 00:08:08.037
let's define an expression for
what a gyroscope measures.

124
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:13.690
The angular rotation rate,
derived from all three gyroscopes,

125
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.781
is the angular velocity of the body
frame relative to an inertial frame,

126
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:19.476
expressed in the body frame.

127
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:25.016
To it will be add a slowly
varying bias term and

128
00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:29.803
a white Gaussian additive noise
term to model sensor errors.

129
00:08:29.803 --> 00:08:34.013
Although gyroscopes do measure the
rotation of the Earth, it's often safe to

130
00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:38.559
ignore this for applications where we care
only about motion over a short duration.

131
00:08:40.531 --> 00:08:44.793
Our accelerometer measurement model
will have similar noise and bias terms.

132
00:08:44.793 --> 00:08:49.259
But now instead of measuring body
accelerations directly as we could do with

133
00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:53.377
rotational rates, we need to
explicitly remove the effect of gravity

134
00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:57.658
using our fundamental equation for
accelerometers in a gravity field.

135
00:08:59.453 --> 00:09:03.295
Since the accelerometers measure
acceleration in the IMU body frame,

136
00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:06.880
we will need to keep track of
the orientation at all times in order to

137
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.458
be able to perform
the necessary subtraction.

138
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.487
Finally, let's discuss a few
important limitations of our models.

139
00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:22.252
First, an accurate orientation estimate is
critical for accurate position estimates.

140
00:09:22.252 --> 00:09:26.540
When we convert the measured specific
force into an acceleration we have to make

141
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.101
sure that the direction
of gravity is correct.

142
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.949
Otherwise even a small error in
orientation can cause us to think that we

143
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:34.883
are accelerating when we're not.

144
00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:39.665
Second, both of the models
we derived ignore

145
00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:42.353
the effects of the Earth's rotation.

146
00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:45.540
For longer distance navigation,
this is in fact, important.

147
00:09:47.092 --> 00:09:51.072
Finally, the models we have
derived are for strapdown IMUs.

148
00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:55.245
These are IMUs that are physically
strapped down to the vehicle and

149
00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:58.311
do not incorporate
a spinning wheel on gimbals.

150
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:01.462
Although a latter can be much more
accurate, they are rarely used in

151
00:10:01.462 --> 00:10:04.462
automotive applications because
of their bulk and their cost.

152
00:10:06.142 --> 00:10:11.070
To summarize, in this video we learned
that a 6 degree of freedom IMU is

153
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.110
composed of three gyroscopes and
three accelerometers.

154
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.275
The gyroscopes measure rotational
rates in the sensor frame.

155
00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:23.533
And accelerometers measure
the non-gravitational specific force in

156
00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:24.960
the sensor frame as well.

157
00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:30.430
Since strapdown IMUs are tricky
to calibrate and drift over time,

158
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.832
we'll need another sensor to periodically
correct our posed estimates.

159
00:10:34.832 --> 00:10:40.022
For this, we can use the modern system
of global navigation satellites.

160
00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:44.173
We'll talk more about

161
00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:48.983
this in the next lecture.

162
00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:54.062
