00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.750
Welcome to module three of
our state estimation course.

2
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.360
In this module, we're
going to introduce you to

3
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.545
two sensors that you can use to
help localize our self-driving car.

4
00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.580
To do this, we'll first review

5
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.525
some 3D kinematics and several
important reference frames,

6
00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:43.070
then discuss some details about
how we can represent rotations,

7
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.080
and finally, we'll present

8
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.945
the inertial measurement unit and
Global Navigation Satellite Systems.

9
00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.635
But first, it's useful to
review a bit of 3D geometry.

10
00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.965
To track how our car moves,

11
00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:58.700
we'll need to know how we can express

12
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.985
that motion using
mathematical tools and notation.

13
00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:04.760
In this lesson, we'll

14
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.305
review how reference frames
affect vector coordinates,

15
00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:12.515
compare and contrast different
rotation representations,

16
00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:14.690
and present several
reference frames that'll be

17
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.945
important in our next lesson on sensors.

18
00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.030
Recall that a vector is

19
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.765
a geometric object that has
a magnitude and a direction.

20
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.390
Often, we treat the concept of a vector

21
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.645
interchangeably with the concept
of vector coordinates,

22
00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:33.995
or the set of numbers that represent
the vector's direction and magnitude.

23
00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:37.415
This however is not necessarily correct.

24
00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.865
If we imagine that the vector
is fixed in space,

25
00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.650
then its coordinates will change

26
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.770
depending on the way in
which we observe it.

27
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.260
More precisely, the same
vector quantity will have

28
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.180
different coordinates depending

29
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.960
on which coordinate
frame or reference frame

30
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.260
we choose to express it in.

31
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.580
We will use the following
notation: In frame a,

32
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.310
the vector r has notation r sub a.

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.515
Likewise in frame b,

34
00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:07.490
it has the coordinates r sub b.

35
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.450
To convert from one set of
coordinates to another,

36
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.380
we will require a rotation
matrix that tells us

37
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.700
exactly how one frame is rotated
with respect to the other.

38
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.650
For this, we will use the notation
bold capital C with the subscripts

39
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.000
indicating the initial and final
reference frames from right to left.

40
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.150
Often, it will also be useful for
us to discuss how the coordinates

41
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.155
of points change as we move from
one reference frame to another.

42
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:42.740
For example, we may know the position
of a building in some frame,

43
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.745
and now we'd like to know its position
in our current vehicle frame.

44
00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:50.090
To compute this, we use vector addition

45
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.455
making sure to express all of the
coordinates in the same reference frame.

46
00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:57.890
We will use superscripts
on the coordinates to

47
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.055
indicate the start and
end point of a 3D vector,

48
00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.785
again from right to left,

49
00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.350
and a subscript to indicate
the frame in which

50
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.610
this is expressed just as before.

51
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.190
We can manipulate this expression
to solve for the coordinates in

52
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.360
the vehicle frame or an appropriate
inertial frame, for example.

53
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.750
A critical component of tracking
reference frames is tracking

54
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.400
their orientation or rotation with
respect to some base reference frame.

55
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.210
Rotations are particularly tricky
mathematical objects and they can be

56
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.845
the source of major bugs if not
dealt with carefully and diligently.

57
00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:37.925
There are many different ways
to represent rotations.

58
00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.780
The most common is to use a three by

59
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.235
three rotation matrix
as we've done before.

60
00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:46.340
This matrix defines
the relationship between

61
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.620
the basis vectors of two reference
frames in terms of dot products.

62
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.265
For this reason, it's often called
the direction cosine matrix.

63
00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:58.670
An important property to
remember is that the inverse

64
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.280
of a rotation matrix
is just its transpose.

65
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.610
A second way to represent rotations is to

66
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.115
use something called unit quaternions.

67
00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:12.620
Quaternions are an interesting
mathematical topic

68
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.855
in their own right, but for us,

69
00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.330
it's sufficient to note
that a unit quaternion

70
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.060
can be represented as
a four-dimensional vector of

71
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.385
unit length that parameterizes

72
00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:25.590
a rotation about an axis
defined by the vector u,

73
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.955
and an angle phi about that vector.

74
00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:32.750
We can convert a quaternion
to a rotation matrix by using

75
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.545
this somewhat tedious but
straightforward algebraic expression.

76
00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.415
Why would we ever want
to use quaternions?

77
00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:40.970
Well, they don't suffer from

78
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.840
singularities and they only need
four parameters instead of nine.

79
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.860
Finally, another way of representing

80
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.040
a rotation is using three numbers
called Euler angles.

81
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.800
These angles represent an arbitrary
rotation as the composition of

82
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.925
three separate rotations about
different principal axes.

83
00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:04.380
Euler angles are attractive in part

84
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.880
because they are
a parsimonious representation

85
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.515
requiring only three parameters instead
of nine for a full rotation matrix.

86
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:15.485
Unfortunately,
Euler angle representations

87
00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:18.265
are subject to what are
called singularities.

88
00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:21.950
Singularities complicate
state estimation because they represent

89
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.335
particular rotations from which to
Euler angles are indistinguishable.

90
00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:31.070
Neither quaternions nor
rotation matrices suffer

91
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.280
from this problem at the expense
of using more parameters.

92
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.505
So, which of these representations do
self-driving vehicle engineers use?

93
00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:42.710
Well, it depends.

94
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.290
Each has advantages and disadvantages.

95
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.240
A rotation matrix can
represent any rotation but

96
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.845
requires nine parameters
and had six constraints.

97
00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:59.269
A unit quaternion can also be
used to represent any rotation,

98
00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:01.675
but it also has a constraint.

99
00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:05.400
To use a unit quaternion to
actually rotate a vector,

100
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.715
we also require some additional algebra

101
00:06:07.715 --> 00:06:10.770
beyond simple matrix multiplication.

102
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.910
Finally, Euler angles are unconstrained,

103
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.730
intuitive to visualize and
use only three parameters,

104
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.500
but are subject to singularities.

105
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.850
Finally, let's look at

106
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.600
four important reference frames that
we'll use when localizing our vehicle.

107
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.075
The first frame is the Earth-Centered
Inertial Frame or ECIF.

108
00:06:36.075 --> 00:06:39.815
This frame has its origin
at the center of the earth,

109
00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:42.080
the z axis points true north,

110
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.465
and the x and y axis are fixed with
respect to the very distant stars.

111
00:06:46.465 --> 00:06:50.320
This means that although the earth
rotates about the z axis,

112
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.450
the x and y axes do not move.

113
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.485
Next, the Earth-Eentered
Earth-Fixed Frame,

114
00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:03.340
or ECEF is just like ECIF except that

115
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.440
it's x axis is aligned with the Prime
Meridian and spins with the earth.

116
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.350
The y-axis is determined
by the right-hand rule.

117
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.270
Here, you can see an animation that
shows the difference between the ECEF,

118
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.035
which is fixed to the earth,

119
00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:25.760
and the ECIF, which is fixed with
respect to the distance stars.

120
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.010
Although ECEF and ECIF are useful when

121
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.534
we discuss satellites and
inertial sensing onboard aircraft,

122
00:07:33.534 --> 00:07:35.990
for practical car applications,

123
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.955
we'll usually want to use a frame that
is fixed with respect to the ground.

124
00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:45.680
For this, we'll use what we referred
to as the navigation frame.

125
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.130
A very common navigation frame
is one that is attached to

126
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:55.030
some germane starting point and
aligned with north, east, and down.

127
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.550
Finally, we also often
need to think about

128
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.494
a sensor frame that is rigidly
attached to a sensor like a LIDAR,

129
00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:05.705
a GPS receiver, or
an inertial measurement unit.

130
00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:09.680
This frame will typically be distinct
from the general vehicle frame,

131
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.755
which can be placed anywhere on
the vehicle that is convenient,

132
00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:15.020
at the center of mass for example.

133
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.920
For localization, we will often
ignore the distinction between

134
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.450
the vehicle and sensor frame and assume
that if we can track the sensor,

135
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.280
we should be able to track any point on

136
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.815
the vehicle given proper calibration,

137
00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:30.660
a topic we investigate later.

138
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.700
To summarize, vector quantities can be

139
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.410
expressed in different reference frames
through rotations and translations.

140
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.535
Rotations can be parameterized
by rotation matrices,

141
00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:45.935
quaternions, or Euler angles,

142
00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:49.800
each of which has advantages
and disadvantages.

143
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.840
The Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed,
Earth-Centered Inertial,

144
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.330
and navigation frames are important
reference frames for localization.

145
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.740
In the next video, we'll discuss how we

146
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.570
can use the tools we learned about in

147
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:10.380
this lesson to track motion by
using an inertial measurement unit.
