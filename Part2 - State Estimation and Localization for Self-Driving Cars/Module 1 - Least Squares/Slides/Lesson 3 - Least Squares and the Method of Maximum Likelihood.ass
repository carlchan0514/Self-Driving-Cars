00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.280
Welcome to the final
lesson of module one.

2
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.780
We'll finish off
the module by

3
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.510
discussing an
important connection,

4
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.410
that will help to provide
further intuition

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.390
for the method of
least squares.

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.600
Specifically, by
the end of this lesson,

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.430
you'll be able to
state the connection

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.200
between the method
of least squares

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.120
and maximum
likelihood estimation

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.760
with Gaussian
random variables.

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
Let's begin by recalling

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.450
the least squares
criterion from

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.285
the very first video
in this module.

14
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:44.840
We found the
best estimates

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.980
of some unknown,

16
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.780
but constant parameters by

17
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.950
determining
the values that

18
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.120
minimize the sum of

19
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.465
squared errors based
on our measurements.

20
00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.485
But we can ask, why
squared errors?

21
00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:58.095
Why not cubed errors,

22
00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:00.830
or square root errors,
or something else?

23
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.690
This is actually
a particularly

24
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.340
deep question and there is

25
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.650
a whole field of
robust statistics

26
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.135
dedicated to it.

27
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.560
You can indeed use

28
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.880
different error functions,

29
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.530
but we'll go over
two reasons why

30
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.545
squared errors are
attractive and relevant.

31
00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.705
The first is simple.

32
00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:19.850
Squared errors allow
us to solve for

33
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.530
the optimal
parameters with

34
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.695
relatively
straightforward algebra.

35
00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.040
If the measurement
model is linear,

36
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.325
minimizing the squared
error criterion

37
00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:29.690
amounts to
solving a linear

38
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.610
system of equations.

39
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.500
The second reason
has to do with

40
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.660
probability and
a deep connection between

41
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.950
least squares and

42
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.050
maximum likelihood
estimators

43
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.495
under the assumption
of Gaussian noise.

44
00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.010
As you may have guessed,

45
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.705
this connection
was first derived

46
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.730
in a particular
form by Gauss.

47
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.620
So, it's no surprise
that it involves

48
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.570
Gaussian random
variables or

49
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.165
equivalently
Gaussian noise.

50
00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.000
To understand this
fundamental connection,

51
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.180
let's first discuss
maximum likelihood.

52
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.370
Instead of writing
down a loss,

53
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.765
we can approach
the problem of

54
00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.120
optimal parameter
estimation by asking,

55
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.590
which parameters make

56
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.220
our recorded measurements
the most likely?

57
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.140
To keep things simple,

58
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.445
we'll stick to
a single scalar parameter

59
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.110
to build our intuition.

60
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.910
For example, let's look

61
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.800
again at measuring
resistance.

62
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.815
Given what we know
about probability,

63
00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:22.670
if we have
four possible values

64
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.395
for this unknown
resistance parameter,

65
00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:26.780
capital X, small x sub A

66
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.490
through small x sub D,

67
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.110
and each gives rise to

68
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.955
the following
conditional probability

69
00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:33.665
on our measurement Y,

70
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.510
which value would maximize

71
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.460
the conditional
likelihood given

72
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.380
the measurement Y sub mes?

73
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.485
That's right. X sub A.

74
00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.500
The highest
probability density at

75
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.910
the measured location is

76
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.340
given by the green curve,

77
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.150
which means
that X sub A is

78
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.260
our most likely parameter

79
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.760
value given
this measurement.

80
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.700
Now, if we take

81
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.930
our simple
measurement model,

82
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.770
we can convert it to

83
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.180
a probability density by

84
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.350
assuming a density for
our additive noise.

85
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.630
The unknown parameter, X,

86
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.560
becomes the mean
of this density

87
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.820
and the variance is simply

88
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.575
our noise variance.

89
00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.870
Recall that the
probability density of

90
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.310
a Gaussian
random variable is

91
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.950
given by the
following equation.

92
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.170
This means that
we can express

93
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.430
our measurement
likelihood for

94
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.055
a single measurement
as follows.

95
00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:24.154
If we have multiple

96
00:03:24.154 --> 00:03:25.745
independent measurements,

97
00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:28.030
each with the same
noise variance,

98
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.660
we can simply
take the product

99
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.235
of multiple Gaussians,

100
00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:34.050
which results in
another Gaussian.

101
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.860
We can try to maximize
this likelihood with

102
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.530
respect to the mean
parameter X half.

103
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.295
To do this, we'll use
a technique that's

104
00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:48.905
often used in
optimization.

105
00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:50.869
Instead of maximizing

106
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.319
the likelihood directly,

107
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.765
we'll take it's logarithm

108
00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:55.325
and maximize that.

109
00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:56.960
Since the likelihood will

110
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.610
always be a
positive number and

111
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.140
because the logarithm is

112
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.405
a monotonically
increasing function,

113
00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:04.970
this will not affect
the final result,

114
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.290
which is very convenient.

115
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.380
Once we apply

116
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.194
the logarithm to
this likelihood,

117
00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.010
we see that something
pops out that

118
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.840
looks a lot like the sum
of squared errors.

119
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.040
The constant C in
this expression

120
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.480
refers to terms that are

121
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.310
not a function of X and

122
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.780
ones which we can
safely ignore.

123
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.830
The last step is now to

124
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.900
realize that the arg max
of the function

125
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.550
F is the same as

126
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.510
the arg min of the

127
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.445
negative of that function.

128
00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:37.070
Using this fact,
we can turn

129
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.949
our likelihood
maximization into

130
00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.120
a minimization of

131
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.350
the sum of squared errors.

132
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.800
For that,
minimizing the sum

133
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.910
of squared errors is

134
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.114
equivalent to maximizing
the likelihood

135
00:04:52.114 --> 00:04:53.540
of a set of measurements,

136
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.740
assuming that
the measurements

137
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.285
are corrupted by additive,

138
00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:58.250
independent,
Gaussian noise

139
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.440
that's of equal variance.

140
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.600
Furthermore, if we

141
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.295
maintain the same
assumptions,

142
00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:05.510
but change the variance of

143
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.810
the Gaussian noise
for each measurement,

144
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.520
we can arrive at
the same criterion as

145
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.460
we saw in our weighted
least squares video.

146
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.320
So, in both cases,

147
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.125
the maximum
likelihood estimate,

148
00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:19.260
given additive
Gaussian noise,

149
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.350
is equivalent to
the least squares or

150
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.910
weighted least
squares solutions

151
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.050
we derived earlier.

152
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.595
So, why is this result
so important?

153
00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:30.410
Our self-driving car will

154
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.520
have to deal with many,

155
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.795
many sources of error.

156
00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:35.375
Some of which are very
difficult to model.

157
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:37.820
However, the central
limit theorem,

158
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.350
tells us that when

159
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.840
combining all of
these errors together,

160
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.460
they can reasonably
be modeled by

161
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.370
a single Gaussian
error distribution.

162
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.620
We would like to
model our system

163
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.715
probabilistically

164
00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.350
and yet maintain
simplicity

165
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.700
in calculations.

166
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.950
If our errors
are Gaussian,

167
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.000
then the best maximum
likelihood estimate

168
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.710
of the parameters
of interest,

169
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.980
is exactly the least
squares solution

170
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.480
we're already
familiar with.

171
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.925
Easy. To finish off,

172
00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:07.420
let's discuss
one important

173
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.490
caveat for this method.

174
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.655
When we use the method
of least squares,

175
00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:14.200
measurement
outliers can have

176
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.750
a significant effect
on our final estimate.

177
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.489
To understand why,

178
00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:19.480
consider that under

179
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.130
a Gaussian distribution,

180
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.780
a sample that
is two standard

181
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.550
deviations away
from the mean,

182
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.780
has less than a five

183
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.775
percent probability
of occurring.

184
00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:29.650
As a result, if there are

185
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.795
some outliers in
our measurement data,

186
00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:33.819
the method of
maximum likelihood,

187
00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:34.955
and equivalently,

188
00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:36.625
the method of
least squares,

189
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:38.585
will put significant
importance

190
00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:40.175
on these measurements.

191
00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:42.560
So, the estimated value of

192
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.000
our parameter
will be pulled

193
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.755
strongly by
these outliers.

194
00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:48.380
Our optimal method
will be skewed

195
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.685
so that the outlying
measurement

196
00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:51.200
is more likely.

197
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.270
This can happen to
many estimators

198
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.290
using sensor data from a

199
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.745
self-driving vehicle.

200
00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:57.410
Outliers might
result from people

201
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.000
walking in the middle
of a Lidar scan,

202
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.510
for example, or from
a bad GPS signal.

203
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.240
Consider our
resistor example.

204
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.185
With one outlying
measurement

205
00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:11.150
that may come from
a simple accident,

206
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.610
the final estimate is
pulled significantly

207
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.870
away from that of
the outlier free case.

208
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.040
We always want to be

209
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.930
cognizant of
outliers and try

210
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.670
to quantify
the error distribution

211
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.110
whenever possible,

212
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.550
before blindly applying

213
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.865
maximum likelihood
or least squares.

214
00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:28.590
Now,

215
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.080
that we've derived
this connection between

216
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.165
maximum likelihood
and least squares,

217
00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:33.470
we're ready to extend

218
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.670
our recursive
least squares

219
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.205
estimator to
the full common filter,

220
00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:38.960
one of the most
famous algorithms

221
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.810
of the 20th century.

222
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.475
To summarize,

223
00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:43.640
we've learned that
the method of

224
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.920
least squares and
weighted least squares

225
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.930
produce the same
estimates as

226
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.440
maximum likelihood,
given Gaussian noise.

227
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.780
This is particularly
important because

228
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.745
many complex
noise sources,

229
00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:59.770
when added, will tend
towards a Gaussian.

230
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.040
However,

231
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.810
it's always important
to be wary of

232
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.310
outlier measurements
that can

233
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.405
significantly affect

234
00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:07.520
our final estimate values.

235
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.319
In the next module,

236
00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.730
we'll take a look
at how we can

237
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.110
now extend what
we've learned

238
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.040
about least squares and

239
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.240
parameter estimation

240
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.454
to continually
varying states,

241
00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.890
that may have more
complex nonlinear models

242
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.990
associated with
them. See you there.
