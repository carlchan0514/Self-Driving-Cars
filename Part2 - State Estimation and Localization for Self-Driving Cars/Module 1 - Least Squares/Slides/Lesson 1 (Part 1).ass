00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.540
Hello, and welcome to course two of
the self-driving car specialization.

2
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.565
In this course, we'll cover state
estimation with a focus on localization.

3
00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:33.360
Let's first begin by
defining a few key terms.

4
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.060
Localization is the method
by which we determine

5
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.660
the position and orientation
of a vehicle within the world.

6
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.545
As you can probably imagine,

7
00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:43.925
accurate localization
is a key component of

8
00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:46.700
any self-driving car software stack.

9
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.590
If we want to drive autonomously,

10
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.615
we certainly need to know where we are.

11
00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:54.020
To accomplish this, we
can use state estimation.

12
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.735
This is the process of
computing a physical quantity

13
00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.555
like position from a set of measurements.

14
00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.900
Since any real-world measurements
will be imprecise,

15
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.780
we will develop methods that
try to find the best or

16
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.030
optimal value given some assumptions

17
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.235
about our sensors and the external world.

18
00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:14.330
Related to state estimation is
the idea of parameter estimation.

19
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.640
Unlike a state, which we will define as

20
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.895
a physical quantity
that changes over time,

21
00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:21.530
a parameter is constant over time.

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.220
Position and orientation are
states of a moving vehicle,

23
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.380
while the resistance of
a particular resistor in

24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.370
the electrical sub-system of
a vehicle would be a parameter.

25
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.210
In the first module or
week one of the course,

26
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.030
we will cover a common technique
in state estimation,

27
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.655
the method of least squares.

28
00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:42.470
By the end of this week,

29
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.890
you'll know a little bit about
the history of least squares and you'll

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.430
learn about the method of
ordinary least squares and its cousin,

31
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.935
the method of weighted least squares.

32
00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:56.990
Then, we'll cover the method of
recursive least squares and finally,

33
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.195
discuss the link between least squares

34
00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:02.615
and the maximum likelihood
estimation technique.

35
00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.135
In the first lesson of this module,

36
00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:07.130
we'll introduce the method
of least squares

37
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.345
and something called
the squared error criterion.

38
00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:12.580
By the end of the video,

39
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.760
you'll be able to describe how
the method of least squares was first

40
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.015
used by Carl Friedrich Gauss in
the discovery of the planetoid Ceres.

41
00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:25.460
Describe the least
error criterion and how

42
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.745
it's used in estimating
the best parameters.

43
00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:32.330
Derive the necessary
normal equations that

44
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.390
we'll need to solve to use
the method. Let's begin.

45
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.590
The method of least squares dates to

46
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.050
the late 18th century well

47
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.990
before anyone had considered
the concept of automobiles.

48
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.030
On January 1st, 1801,

49
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.944
an Italian priest and astronomer

50
00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:55.880
Giuseppe Piazzi discovered
a new celestial object in the night sky.

51
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.960
The asteroid or planetoid
now called Ceres.

52
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.290
You can see it here next to
the moon and to the earth.

53
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.180
Piazzi made 24 telescope observations of

54
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.570
this new object over 40 days before
it was lost in the glare of the sun.

55
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.555
Since Ceres is only about
900 kilometers in diameter,

56
00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:20.300
finding it again it was
extremely challenging.

57
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.410
This meant that other astronomers
could not confirm Piazzi's discovery.

58
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.235
To help locate Ceres again,

59
00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:31.010
Carl Friedrich Gauss who has
been called the prince of

60
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.195
mathematicians for his prodigious
contributions to many different fields,

61
00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:39.200
used a method of least squares
to accurately estimate

62
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.555
Ceres orbital parameters based on
Piazza's published measurements.

63
00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.525
With Gauss's calculations in hand,

64
00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:51.110
astronomers were successfully
able to rediscover Ceres

65
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.010
nearly a year after Piazzi had
made his first observations.

66
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.530
Although he published the method in 1809,

67
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.830
Gauss claimed that he
developed least squares in

68
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.960
1795, predating Lesion's work.

69
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.760
Gauss summarized the approach as follows.

70
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.740
The most probable value of an unknown
parameter is that which minimizes

71
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.170
the sum of squared errors between
what we observe and what we expect.

72
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.390
To illustrate how this works,

73
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.890
let's take a simple example.

74
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.080
Suppose you are trying to
measure the value in ohms of

75
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.565
a simple resistor within the drive
system of an autonomous vehicle.

76
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.500
To do this, you grab

77
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.770
a relatively inexpensive multimeter
that's lying around your lab.

78
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.380
Now, let's say you collect these four
separate measurements, sequentially.

79
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.909
If you've studied
electrical circuits before,

80
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.300
you'll probably recall that the type
of carbon film resistors shown

81
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.425
here is color-coded according
to its rated resistance value.

82
00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:59.840
This resistor is rated at one kilo ohm.

83
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.210
However, due to a number of factors,

84
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.785
the true resistance can
vary from the rated value.

85
00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:09.985
In this case, the resistor
has a gold band

86
00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:13.900
which indicates that it can vary
by as much as five percent.

87
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.490
Furthermore, let's imagine that
our multimeter is particularly

88
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.530
poor and that the person making

89
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.570
the measurements is not
particularly careful.

90
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.550
For now, it's sufficient to treat

91
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.370
this noise as equivalent
to a general error

92
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.070
but we'll come back to ways we
can interpret the noise from

93
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.655
a probabilistic perspective
later in the module.

94
00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:39.565
For each of the four measurements,

95
00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:45.085
we define a scalar noise term that is
independent of the other noise terms.

96
00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:48.790
Statistically, we would say
in this case that the noise

97
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.445
is independent and identically
distributed or IID,

98
00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:55.240
and we'll discuss this more later.

99
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.005
Next, we define the error between

100
00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:03.880
each measurement and the actual value
of our resistance x.

101
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.745
But remember, we don't
yet know what x is.

102
00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:12.260
To find x, we square these errors
to arrive at an equation

103
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.330
that is a function of
our measurements and

104
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.640
the unknown resistance
that we're looking for.

105
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.740
With these errors defined,

106
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.430
the method of least squares says that

107
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.505
the resistance value we are looking for,

108
00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:27.470
that is the best estimate of x is

109
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.785
one which minimizes
the squared error criterion,

110
00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:36.390
also sometimes called the squared error
cost function or loss function.

111
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.900
To minimize the squared error criterion,

112
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.770
we'll rewrite our errors
in matrix notation.

113
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.260
This will be especially
helpful when we have to deal

114
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.510
with hundreds or even thousands
of measurements.

115
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.540
We'll define an error vector
identified as bold e,

116
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.570
that is a function of
our observations stacked into

117
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.725
a vector y and a matrix H
called the Jacobian.

118
00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:07.700
Finally, our true resistance x.
H has the dimensions m by n,

119
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.970
where m is the number of
measurements and n is the number

120
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.360
of unknowns or parameters
that we wish to estimate.

121
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.430
In general, this will be
a rectangular matrix which we can

122
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.970
write down quite easily
in this linear case.

123
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.810
It will require some more
mathematical effort to compute when

124
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.365
we discuss non-linear estimation
in an upcoming lesson.

125
00:07:30.365 --> 00:07:33.440
Note here that x is a single scaler.

126
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.370
We'll see later that it can be
a vector comprising multiple unknowns.

127
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.460
With these definitions in mind,

128
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.670
we can convert our squared error
criterion to vector notation as follows.

129
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.495
Expanding out the brackets,

130
00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:56.460
we arrive at this somewhat
intimidating expression. So, what now?

131
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.730
Well, remember that we need to minimize

132
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.190
the squared error with respect
to our true resistance x.

133
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.490
From calculus, we know that we can
do this by taking a derivative of

134
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.320
the error function with respect to

135
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.395
the unknown x and setting
the derivative to zero.

136
00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.850
Let's do exactly that.

137
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.440
We'll have to use
some standard matrix expressions.

138
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.080
Re-arranging, we arrive at what
are called the normal equations,

139
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.100
which can be written as
a single matrix formula.

140
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.210
We can solve these to find x-hat,

141
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.790
the resistance which minimizes
our squared error criterion.

142
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.300
This expression has
a unique solution if and only

143
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.465
if H transpose H is not singular.

144
00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:45.220
In other words, if
the matrix has an inverse.

145
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.760
If we have m measurements
and n unknown parameters,

146
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.705
H transpose H will be n by n.

147
00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:56.750
The matrix will be invertible if and only

148
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.079
if m is greater than or equal to n. So,

149
00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:01.880
we need at least as many measurements as

150
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.550
unknowns in order to derive
the least squares solution.

151
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.570
This will usually not be a problem.

152
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.940
In fact, we'll often face the challenge

153
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.985
of dealing with too many measurements.

154
00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:16.130
But nevertheless, you should keep

155
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.650
this limitation in mind when
working with the formula.

156
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.140
Coming back to our particular
resistance problem,

157
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.750
let's fill out our variables.

158
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.450
Once we have these quantities,

159
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.725
it's just a matter of plug and chug.

160
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:32.900
The expression is quite
straightforward to code

161
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.090
up as you'll see in
your module assignment.

162
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.680
Note here that
the expression simplifies to

163
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.755
the arithmetic mean of
our four measurements.

164
00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:46.010
Perhaps this is something you
thought of doing all along.

165
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.765
Now, we have another justification
for using the arithmetic mean,

166
00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:53.405
it minimizes the simple
least squares criterion.

167
00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:58.535
Finally, we should note two important
assumptions that we've made.

168
00:09:58.535 --> 00:10:02.495
First, we've assumed that
our measurement model is linear.

169
00:10:02.495 --> 00:10:04.820
This is a very important assumption that

170
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.510
is often broken in complex systems.

171
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.240
We'll discuss non-linear measurement
models in later lessons.

172
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.710
Second, we've assumed that all of

173
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.610
our measurements have an equal weight
in our error equation.

174
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.590
To put this another way,

175
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.010
we've assumed that we care about
each of our measurements equally.

176
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.280
To summarize, in this video,

177
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.850
you've learned that the method of
least squares was pioneered by

178
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.760
Carl Friedrich Gauss who
used it to accurately

179
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.510
predict the orbit of a new planet
like object called Ceres.

180
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.830
You saw how we can minimize

181
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.345
the least squares criterion to solve
for parameter values of interest.

182
00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:50.990
We noted that the method of
ordinary least squares assumes

183
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.910
a linear measurement model and

184
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.655
can't handle measurements
of unequal importance.

185
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.920
In the next video, we'll
extend the method of

186
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.070
least squares to the method
of weighted least squares,

187
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.950
which can account for measurements
of varying importance.
