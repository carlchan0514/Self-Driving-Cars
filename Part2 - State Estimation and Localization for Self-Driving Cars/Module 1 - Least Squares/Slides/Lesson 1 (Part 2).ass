00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.675
In the last video,

2
00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.305
we saw how we could use the method
of least squares to solve for

3
00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:24.405
a more correct value of resistance
given a set of noisy measurements.

4
00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.075
In this video, we'll ask the question,

5
00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:29.160
what can we do if we suspect that some of

6
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.920
our measurements are of
better quality than others?

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.765
By the end of this video,

8
00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.960
you'll be able to derive and minimize

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.150
the weighted least squares criterion

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.710
that will let us handle measurements of

11
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.660
different quality and
compare this new method to

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.345
the method of regular or
ordinary least squares

13
00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.580
that we discussed in the previous video.

14
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.045
Let's begin. One reason
we may want to trust

15
00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:54.815
certain measurements more than others

16
00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:57.410
is that they may come
from a better sensor.

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.980
For example, a number of
our resistance measurements

18
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.765
could have come from a much more
expensive multi-meter than the others.

19
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.645
Further, from now on,

20
00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:09.170
we'll also drop the assumption
that we're only estimating

21
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.415
one parameter and derive
the more general normal equations.

22
00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:15.530
This will allow us to formulate a way to

23
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.265
estimate multiple parameters at one time.

24
00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:23.210
For example, if we wanted to estimate
several resistance values at once.

25
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.795
Let's begin by using
the following general notation.

26
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.230
We'll have a set of m measurements
that are related to a set

27
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.715
of n unknown parameters
through a linear model.

28
00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.879
Recall that H is rj cobian matrix

29
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:41.195
whose form and entries will depend
on the particular problem at hand.

30
00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:44.360
One way to interpret
the ordinary method of

31
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.795
least squares is to say that we
are implicitly assuming that

32
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:52.475
each noise term v_i is
an independent random variable

33
00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:54.650
across measurements and has

34
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.875
an equal variance or
standard deviation if you prefer,

35
00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:01.300
IID as we mentioned in
the previous video.

36
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.010
If we instead assume that each noise
term has a different variance,

37
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.950
we can define our noise
covariance as follows.

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.885
With this definition, we can define
a weighted least squares criterion.

39
00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:19.030
By expanding this expression,

40
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.720
we can see why we call this
weighted least squares.

41
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.170
Each squared error term
is now weighted by

42
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.895
the inverse of the variance associated
with the corresponding measurement.

43
00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:34.600
In other words, the lower
the variance of the noise,

44
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.800
the more strongly it's

45
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.535
associated error term will be
weighted in the loss function.

46
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:44.095
We care more about errors which
come from low noise measurements

47
00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.400
since those should tell us a lot about

48
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.775
the true values of our
unknown parameters.

49
00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:54.170
Before we see how we can minimize
this new weighted criterion,

50
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.360
let's look at what
happens if we set all of

51
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.690
the noise standard deviations
to the same value sigma.

52
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.735
In this case, we can factor out
the variance in the denominator.

53
00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:08.270
Since the sigma squared term is

54
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.005
constant it will not
affect the minimization.

55
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.830
This means that in the case
of equal variances,

56
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.165
the same parameters that minimize
our weighted least squares criterion

57
00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.820
will also minimize
our ordinary least squares

58
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.890
criterion as we should expect.

59
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.365
Returning to our weighted
least squares criterion,

60
00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:33.445
we approach it's minimization
the same way as before,

61
00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.350
we take a derivative.

62
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.805
In the general case where we have

63
00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:41.240
n unknown parameters
in our bold vector x,

64
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.420
this derivative will
actually be a gradient.

65
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.065
Setting the gradient of the zero vector,

66
00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:52.190
we then solve for our best or
optimal parameter vector x hat.

67
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.995
This leads to another set
of normal equations

68
00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:58.770
this time called the
weighted normal equations.

69
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.250
Let's take a look at an example of

70
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.650
how this method of
weighted least squares works.

71
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.455
We'll take the same data
we collected before,

72
00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:11.810
but now assume that the last two
measurements were actually taken with

73
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.680
a multimeter that had
a much smaller noise variance.

74
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.860
Be careful here, the numbers we list are

75
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.990
standard deviations which is why
they have the units of ohms.

76
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.350
In order to use them in our formulation,

77
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.955
we will need to square
them to get the variances.

78
00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:31.790
Defining our variables and then

79
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.705
evaluating our weighted
least squares solution,

80
00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:37.940
we can see that the final
resistance value we get is much

81
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.230
closer to what the more accurate
multimeter measured as expected.

82
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.230
Here's a quick summary of the methods of

83
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.945
least squares and weighted least squares.

84
00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:53.300
By using weighted least squares,

85
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.620
we can vary the importance of
each measurement to the final estimate.

86
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.320
It's important to be
comfortable working with

87
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.465
different measurement variances and

88
00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:05.660
also with measurements that
are sometimes correlated.

89
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.560
A self-driving car will have a number
of different and complex sensors on

90
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.020
board and we need to make sure that
we model our error sources correctly.

91
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.160
So, there you have it,
weighted least squares.

92
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.680
In this video, we discussed how

93
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.080
certain measurements may
come from sensors with

94
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.840
better noise characteristics
and should therefore

95
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.330
be weighted more heavily in
our least squares criterion.

96
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.810
Using this intuition, we derived the
weighted least squares criterion and

97
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.650
the associated weighted normal equations
that can be solved to

98
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.765
yield the weighted least squares estimate
of a set of constant parameters.

99
00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:46.715
In the next video,

100
00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:51.005
we'll look at modifying the method of
least squares to work recursively,

101
00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:54.350
that is to compute an optimal estimate
based on a stream of

102
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.430
measurements without having to
acquire the entire set beforehand.

103
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.900
This will be very important when
we look at state estimation,

104
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.420
or the problem of estimating quantities
that change continuously over time.
