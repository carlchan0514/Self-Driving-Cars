1
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.155
Congratulations.

2
00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.460
You've almost completed

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.355
this specialization
on self-driving cars.

4
00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.960
Now it's time to take everything

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.745
you've learned in
the fourth course

6
00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:27.615
on planning and apply it
in a real-world project.

7
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:29.450
In this project we'll be tying

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.610
together many of
the concepts we've discussed

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.380
throughout this course to create

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.530
a fully functional motion
planner for an autonomous car.

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.645
By doing this, you
will have created

12
00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:41.390
a complete motion planner
that is able to handle

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.210
real-world scenarios
that are consistently

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.175
encountered by autonomous
vehicles every day.

15
00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:51.215
In particular, by
the end of this project

16
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:52.400
you should be able to use

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.970
the polynomial spiral
optimization formulation we've

18
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.370
covered in Module seven lectures

19
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.480
to generate paths for
an autonomous car.

20
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.770
From these paths, you
should be able to

21
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.840
perform static obstacle avoidance

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.195
using a circle-based
collision checking method

23
00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.300
we developed in Module four.

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.760
From a feasible
collision-free path

25
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.515
you should then be
able to generate

26
00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:16.660
a velocity profile that takes

27
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.690
a leading dynamic obstacles
into consideration.

28
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.165
Finally, you should
be able to implement

29
00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.790
a state machine
behavioral planner that can

30
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.725
handle a stop sign scenario

31
00:01:26.725 --> 00:01:30.040
using the concepts
discussed in Module six.

32
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.450
The main objective of

33
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.910
this project is to integrate
the knowledge that we've

34
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.400
discussed throughout
the modules of this course

35
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.110
to create a full motion planner

36
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.550
for an autonomous vehicle.

37
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.200
To do this, you will be writing

38
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.260
Python code to interact
with the CARLA simulator,

39
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.550
and which we've prepared

40
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.965
a scenario that
you must navigate.

41
00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:50.200
We will be reusing the controller

42
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.000
developed in course one for
our autonomous vehicle,

43
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.730
so we can focus solely on

44
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.620
the planning aspects for the car.

45
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.710
We will also be assuming that
all relevant knowledge of

46
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.480
our surroundings is available to

47
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.030
us as the car traverses
the scenario.

48
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.250
This means we will
not be integrating

49
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.980
the sensing and image
processing methods developed

50
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.100
in course two on state
estimation and localization,

51
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.260
and in course three
on visual perception.

52
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.250
In this project, you will
be following a set of

53
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.185
way-points in
a given road network

54
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.820
until you reach a goal.

55
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.920
There are three
main challenges in

56
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.940
this scenario that you will

57
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.860
face before reaching the goal.

58
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.635
The first will be
a static parked obstacle

59
00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:31.705
that will be blocking
your current lane.

60
00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:33.700
You'll be given discrete samples

61
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.455
of the footprint of the obstacle,

62
00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.460
and you will need
to use circles to

63
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.625
approximate the footprint
of the ego vehicle along

64
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:43.580
each plan path in order to
quickly compute whether

65
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.955
or not the path is in
collision with the obstacle.

66
00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:49.250
By removing the paths
in collision with

67
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.710
this obstacle from
our planning process,

68
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.195
you will be able to avoid
the obstacle entirely.

69
00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:58.235
Next, you will encounter
a lead vehicle.

70
00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:01.150
This vehicle will be moving
below the speed limit,

71
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.440
and as such you will
have to regulate

72
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.180
your velocity profile accordingly
to prevent a collision.

73
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940
Finally, you will reach

74
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.330
a stop-sign controlled
intersection.

75
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.620
You will need to develop

76
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.250
a state machine that can
handle the stop sign,

77
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.580
which means it must have

78
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.890
the ability to
decelerate to a stop,

79
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.810
briefly weight once stopped,

80
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.510
and then proceed through
the intersection.

81
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.060
Once this is complete,

82
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.630
you will have fully progressed

83
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.460
through our simulation scenario,

84
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.070
and you will have constructed
emotion planner that can

85
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.630
handle many of the challenges

86
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.880
that are present in
autonomous driving.

87
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.130
Your vehicle will
be operating in one

88
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.840
of CARLA tests environments,

89
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.640
so don't hesitate to build out

90
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.230
your planning solution to handle

91
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.060
vehicles at other intersections,

92
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.910
or to navigate from a start
to a goal location,

93
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.290
or even to pass

94
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.960
a lead vehicle if
the roadway is clear ahead.

95
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.150
There are many more
scenarios that you can

96
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.830
consider based on what you've
learned in this course,

97
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.190
and we encourage you
to explore as many of

98
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.235
the concepts from
this specialization as you wish.

99
00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:03.350
If you have any questions that

100
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.180
I didn't answer in this video,

101
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.620
there are further instructions in

102
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.455
the programming
assignment itself,

103
00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:11.975
and you can always ask in
the discussion forums as well.

104
00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.450
I hope you have fun with
this final project.

105
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.880
I'll see you again
once it's completed to

106
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.215
close out the course and
the overall specialization.

107
00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:22.460
Best of luck on
this final project

108
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.570
of this specialization.
