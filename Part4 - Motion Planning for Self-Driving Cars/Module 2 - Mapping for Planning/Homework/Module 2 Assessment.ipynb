    "# Module 2 Assessment\n",
    "Welcome to the assessment for Module 2: Mapping for Planning. In this assessment, you will be generating an occupancy grid using lidar scanner measurements from a moving vehicle in an unknown environment. You will use the inverse scanner measurement model developed in the lessons to map these measurements into occupancy probabilities, and then perform iterative logodds updates to an occupancy grid belief map. After the car has gathered enough data, your occupancy grid should converge to the true map.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, you will:\n",
    "* Gather range measurements of a moving car's surroundings using a lidar scanning function.\n",
    "* Extract occupancy information from the range measurements using an inverse scanner model.\n",
    "* Perform logodds updates on an occupancy grids based on incoming measurements.\n",
    "* Iteratively construct a probabilistic occupancy grid from those log odds updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most exercises, you are provided with a suggested outline. You are encouraged to diverge from the outline if you think there is a better, more efficient way to solve a problem.\n",

It returns a matrix of measured occupancy probability values based on the lidar scan model discussed in the video lectures. The `get_ranges()` function actually returns the scanned ranges value for a given vehicle position and scanner bearing. These two functions are given below.

    "Here is where you will enter your code. Your task is to complete the main simulation loop. After each step of robot motion, you are required to gather range data from your lidar scan, and then apply the inverse scanner model to map these to a measured occupancy belief map. From this, you will then perform a logodds update on your logodds occupancy grid, and update our belief map accordingly. As the car traverses through the environment, the occupancy grid belief map should move closer and closer to the true map. At the code block after the end of the loop, the code will output some values which will be used for grading your assignment. Make sure to copy down these values and save them in a .txt file for when your visualization looks correct. Good luck!"
