00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.510
Welcome to the second lesson in

2
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.345
our module on Dynamic
Object Interaction.

3
00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:21.880
In this video, we will
be extending the topic

4
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.280
of motion prediction
of dynamic objects,

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.955
to include information
available from the HD road map.

6
00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:29.830
To begin, we will discuss

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.330
the different assumptions relied

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.220
on by map-aware where algorithms,

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.990
for motion prediction, To

10
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.390
keep the task simple
and efficient.

11
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.385
Then we will look at applying

12
00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:41.439
a lane following
prediction approach,

13
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.260
to improve position
prediction components.

14
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.030
Next, we'll explore
map-based prediction

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.420
when multiple lane options
are available.

16
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.830
Then we'll explore a
velocity prediction

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.810
around regulatory elements.

18
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.420
Finally, we'll discuss
some of the issues

19
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.940
in short-falls of
map-aware predictions that

20
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.800
revolve around assumptions made

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.555
regarding dynamic objects.
So let's get started.

22
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:06.410
In the previous video,

23
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.335
we explored constant
velocity motion prediction,

24
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.940
which worked well only in

25
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.010
a very limited number
of scenarios.

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.690
Map-aware algorithms make

27
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.700
two broad categories
of assumptions

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.635
to improve the motion predictions

29
00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.720
particularly for vehicles.

30
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.360
Position-based
assumptions to improve

31
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.715
the position component
of the vehicle state,

32
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.680
and velocity-based assumptions to

33
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.240
improve the velocity component.

34
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.260
The first assumption
made to improve

35
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.495
the position component
of the prediction,

36
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.250
is that vehicles driving down

37
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.815
a given lane usually
follow that lane.

38
00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:42.515
Returning to our simple
example scenario,

39
00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:45.139
if we have a vehicle
on a curved roadway,

40
00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:48.320
the vehicle will most likely
turn along with the roadway.

41
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.825
The second assumption
that can be made is that

42
00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.690
a drive lane change or
direction prediction,

43
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.190
can be made based on the state of

44
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.170
the indicator light
of the vehicle.

45
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.300
If such a detection has been made

46
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.050
by the perception stack
for a vehicle,

47
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.990
it is possible to
switch the prediction

48
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.690
to account for
this additional information.

49
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.690
Velocity-based
assumptions are used to

50
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.795
improve the velocity prediction
of a dynamic object.

51
00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.900
All vehicles on the road are
affected by road geometry.

52
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.510
Thus, it is useful
to assume that as

53
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.005
a vehicle approaches a turn
with significant curvature,

54
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.180
the vehicle is likely
to slow down to

55
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.215
avoid exceeding its lateral
acceleration limits.

56
00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:29.570
Finally, velocity prediction
can be greatly enhanced

57
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.450
if we also consider
a regulatory elements,

58
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.250
which the dynamic object
may encounter.

59
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.450
For example, if there
is a stop sign at

60
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.290
a close distance in front
of a dynamic object,

61
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.250
it is safe to assume
that the vehicle will

62
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.010
execute a decelerate
to stop maneuver,

63
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.935
resulting in a lower
velocity over time.

64
00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.245
Well this is not a complete set

65
00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:52.730
of all assumptions that can

66
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.110
be made to improve motion
prediction using HD road maps,

67
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.640
they are sufficient to
illustrate the diversity

68
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.906
of contextual
information available

69
00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:02.930
to improve our predictions.

70
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.870
Further, it is important
to understand that

71
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.670
the more constraints
or assumptions that

72
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.650
are added to a prediction model,

73
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.330
the less generalizable it can

74
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.520
be to all traffic scenarios.

75
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.635
In fact, by the end
of this lesson,

76
00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:16.820
we will see cases where

77
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.039
even these generic assumptions

78
00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.855
can be overly constraining.

79
00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:22.910
Let's now incorporate each of

80
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.740
these map-based assumptions into

81
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.555
our motion prediction methods.

82
00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:29.465
For roadways with
natural curvature,

83
00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.360
we make the assumption
that a vehicle which is on

84
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.070
a drive lane will likely follow

85
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.175
that drive lane
through the curve.

86
00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:39.080
Our motion predictions can
be updated then by using

87
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.130
the center line of

88
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.220
the mainland map as the
predicted path of the vehicle,

89
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.990
instead of the straight line path

90
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.845
generated by constant
velocity predictions.

91
00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.630
Recall the lane that
map definition from module

92
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.210
two of this course
which provides left,

93
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.460
and right lane boundaries
for every lane on

94
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.780
the road from which there can

95
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.150
be a center line to construct it.

96
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.280
The center line of a lane lit is

97
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.170
defined as a set of points making

98
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.880
up a polyline that is equally

99
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.355
spaced from both lane boundaries.

100
00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:09.380
While minor deviations from

101
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.550
the exact center line
can be expected,

102
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.860
the center line can act as

103
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.260
a good motion prediction
approximation.

104
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.300
This is a major step forward over

105
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.995
constant velocity predictions on

106
00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:21.230
any roadway with curvature.

107
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.140
However, by restricting
path predictions

108
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.510
to the center line of
any given lane lit,

109
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.865
will result in two major issues.

110
00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:31.609
The first is that
during normal driving,

111
00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.935
drivers routinely change lanes.

112
00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:35.455
So as mentioned earlier,

113
00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:37.220
such maneuver may be predicted

114
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.215
based on indicator
light perception.

115
00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:41.180
Although not all lean changes by

116
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.850
human drivers are preceded
by an indication.

117
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.935
The second problem that arises

118
00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.660
is that it is regularly the case,

119
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.480
that there is more than one
center line to choose from.

120
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.380
Such as in the case
of an intersection.

121
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.185
For example, at
this simple T junction,

122
00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:57.410
it is possible for the vehicle

123
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.090
to turn either left or right.

124
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.490
This leads us to
the need to consider

125
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.500
multiple hypotheses based on

126
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.700
likely behaviors of the
other agents in the scene.

127
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.620
Again, we have
two options: we can

128
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.935
identify the most likely
behavior using objects state,

129
00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:15.005
appearance, and
track information,

130
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:16.970
and then construct a prediction

131
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.045
based on the most
likely behavior,

132
00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:21.470
or we can construct
a prediction for

133
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.960
the most likely behaviors
and associate

134
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.300
a probability that
the agents will follow

135
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.980
a particular path based on

136
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.650
the state appearance
and track information.

137
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.420
The second approach is

138
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.310
a slight generalization
of the first.

139
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.485
So we will focus
our attention on it.

140
00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:40.415
We refer to this as
multi hypothesis prediction.

141
00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:43.744
In the case of multi-hypothesis
prediction approaches,

142
00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.860
each nominal behavior
of a vehicle

143
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.080
based on the full range
of possibilities

144
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.490
available to it at

145
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.820
its current location in
the HD road map is considered.

146
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.520
For the three-way
intersection example,

147
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.770
we can include three
possibilities: turn left,

148
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.455
turn right, or stay stationary.

149
00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:03.790
Based on corroborating evidence

150
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.530
such as indicators signals,

151
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.379
position to the left or
right of the center line,

152
00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.170
and the state of the vehicle
at the intersection.

153
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.254
It is possible to evaluate

154
00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:15.460
each of the three
hypotheses in terms

155
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.990
of the likelihood the agent will

156
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.050
execute each of them within
the prediction horizon.

157
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.545
These probabilities can be
hard to quantify exactly.

158
00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:26.515
So can either be learned
from training data

159
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:28.000
of many vehicles proceeding

160
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.830
through similar intersections,

161
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.420
or can be engineered and refined
from real-world testing.

162
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.510
Such approaches
traditionally provide

163
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.630
more ambiguous information
to the behavior planner,

164
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.004
requiring this next stage
of the planning process,

165
00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:47.040
to consider multiple scenarios
simultaneously,

166
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.605
and to handle the probabilistic
representation of belief.

167
00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:54.035
However, if handled correctly,

168
00:06:54.035 --> 00:06:56.870
this approach can also
be significantly safer,

169
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.270
enabling defensive
driving strategies,

170
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.740
and rapid re-planning if

171
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.440
probabilities shift based
on new information.

172
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.320
This approach also has
an advantage of being

173
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.990
able to adapt to
human-based driving errors.

174
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.125
Such as forgetting to
signal when changing lanes.

175
00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.320
Now that we understand how
a road map can be used to

176
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.120
improve the positional component

177
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.950
of the predicted trajectories,

178
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.585
let us now dive into
the velocity component.

179
00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:25.340
The first improvement
in this area is

180
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.355
based on the known road
geometry or curvature,

181
00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:29.675
and the prediction of how

182
00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:31.835
other vehicles will react to it.

183
00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:34.760
All vehicles no matter
their making model,

184
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.920
will reduce their velocity
as they enter

185
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.620
sharp curves or execute turns.

186
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.280
We can use an expected
maximum lateral acceleration,

187
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.540
usually in the range of

188
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.420
0.5 to one meter
per second squared,

189
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.825
to improve velocity
estimation along curves.

190
00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.850
The second and more significant

191
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.320
improvement is to incorporate

192
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.845
regulatory elements to
improve velocity estimation.

193
00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:00.800
Given the anticipated path
of the vehicle,

194
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.140
any roadway elements
such as stop signs,

195
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.445
yield signs, speed limit changes
or traffic lights,

196
00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:09.020
can all inform the
velocity prediction.

197
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.820
In the case of traffic lights

198
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.205
the lights state
is also required.

199
00:08:13.205 --> 00:08:16.250
In each case
a stop location can be

200
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.075
predicted based on
the regulatory element line,

201
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:21.300
as defined in the road map.

202
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.335
Then a smooth deceleration
can be applied

203
00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:27.605
to the vehicle velocity
prediction along its path.

204
00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:30.385
In fact, given a HD road map,

205
00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.540
it is possible to
preprocess the map

206
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.180
for nominal trajectories
along each roadway,

207
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.500
and to define lanelet specific
multi-hypothesis priors,

208
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.110
based on nominal
driving behavior.

209
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.510
This serves both as guidance for

210
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.950
the ego vehicle in planning

211
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.885
its behaviors and trajectories,

212
00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:50.030
and also in terms of refining

213
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.015
the motion predictions
for other agents.

214
00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.640
Of course obstructions in

215
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.950
the lane ahead of
a vehicle precedence of

216
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.380
arrival information
at intersections

217
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.270
and lead vehicles in the lane,

218
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.620
can all be integrated to

219
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.335
improve predictions
for other vehicles.

220
00:09:06.335 --> 00:09:08.090
Given the complexity of making

221
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.699
decisions for
a single self-driving car,

222
00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:13.370
there is a limit to
how many variables and

223
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.729
how much depth of information
in logic can be used,

224
00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:18.500
to improve motion prediction.

225
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.680
There is also a limit to
how much we can rely on

226
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.650
assumptions about expected
dynamic object behavior,

227
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.705
to predict future actions.

228
00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:29.720
Dynamic objects do not
always behave according

229
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.645
to the nominal behaviors
expected of the drivers.

230
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.215
They do not exactly
follow the center line,

231
00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:37.230
do not drive at the speed limit,

232
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.690
accelerate and decelerate at
different rates for example.

233
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.100
Further, they may
react to information

234
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.800
not yet available to
the prediction system,

235
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.175
such as a potholes in the road
ahead or a bouncing ball.

236
00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.020
They may simply not observe

237
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.790
a regulatory element as occurs

238
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.265
when a vehicle accidentally
runs a red light.

239
00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:58.580
All these variations must be
accounted for which can be

240
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.050
done to some extent with
the multi-hypothesis approach.

241
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.310
The best approach is
therefore to track

242
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.845
the evolution of beliefs
over the set of hypotheses,

243
00:10:07.845 --> 00:10:10.070
and to update based
on evidence from

244
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.695
the perception stack
at every time step.

245
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.270
There is a great deal of

246
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.490
complexity embedded
in these methods,

247
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.540
and we encourage you to

248
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.460
explore some of
the challenging issues

249
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.910
associated with motion prediction
for self-driving cars,

250
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.440
by digging into the references

251
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.005
included in the
supplementary materials.

252
00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:30.140
This concludes our discussion
of motion prediction.

253
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.255
In today's lesson, we have

254
00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:35.810
described a set of assumptions
for map-aware algorithms,

255
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.245
to improve motion prediction
of vehicles on drive lanes,

256
00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:42.230
defined position and
velocity-based methods

257
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.490
to improve motion prediction,
described multi-hypothesis

258
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.230
prediction as a way to maintain

259
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.040
multiple beliefs about
another vehicles future actions,

260
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.830
and finally identified
some of the issues with

261
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.385
exclusively relying on
map-aware motion prediction.

262
00:10:58.385 --> 00:11:00.890
I hope you will join
us next time where we

263
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.990
will see how to use
our predicted paths,

264
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.120
to calculate a time to collision,

265
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.880
between pairs of dynamic
objects. See you there.
