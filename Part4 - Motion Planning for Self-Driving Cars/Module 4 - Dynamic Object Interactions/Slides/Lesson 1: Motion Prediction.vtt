00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.020
Hi everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.705
Module Four of
our Motion Planning course.

3
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.550
This week, we will
discuss methods

4
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.590
used within the motion planner,

5
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.330
to handle interactions between

6
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.850
dynamic objects and
the ego vehicle.

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880
We will start this week,
by looking at

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.250
the prediction of
dynamic object motion.

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.890
We will then go on to
understanding how we are

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.590
able to use the dynamic
object predictions,

11
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.780
in order to calculate
the time to collision

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.140
between the ego vehicle
and other dynamic objects.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.360
In this lesson, we will define

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.759
motion prediction
for dynamic objects

15
00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:54.620
and identify the importance of

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.000
such predictions in the greater
path planning problem.

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.190
We'll describe the requirements
to accurately and

18
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.340
safely predict the motion
of dynamic objects,

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.735
and explore the challenges
inherent in motion prediction.

20
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:10.670
Finally, we'll perform
our first predictions with

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.935
the constant velocity
prediction model.

22
00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:14.645
Let's get started.

23
00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:16.910
Motion prediction attempts to

24
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.190
estimate the future
positions, headings,

25
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.010
and velocities of
all dynamic objects

26
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.920
in the environment over
some finite horizon.

27
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.870
This is crucially important

28
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.580
for the motion planning problem,

29
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.960
as it allows us to plan

30
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.020
future actions and maneuvers
for the autonomous vehicle,

31
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.855
based on the expected motions
of other objects.

32
00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.930
The predicted paths also
allow us to make sure that

33
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.840
the path which the ego vehicle
plans to execute,

34
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.860
will not collide with

35
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.425
any future objects
at a future time.

36
00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.180
In order to be able to predict

37
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.860
the motion of moving objects,

38
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.150
we must have access to

39
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.805
some information about
the environment around us.

40
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:55.865
Especially as it relates
to dynamic objects.

41
00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.620
For all dynamic objects,

42
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.215
we must first know
the class of the object.

43
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:01.880
This information is vitally

44
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.190
important as most
prediction models have

45
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.140
different algorithmic
approaches to

46
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.630
vehicles as opposed
to pedestrians.

47
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.640
Next, we need to have information

48
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.255
regarding the dynamic
objects current state,

49
00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:15.945
its position, and velocity
in the environment.

50
00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:18.530
Represented here by
a red vector with

51
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.590
the vector origin equal
to the vehicle position,

52
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.200
the vector magnitude
equal to its speed,

53
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.880
and the vector's
direction equal to

54
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.340
its current heading or
direction of travel.

55
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910
Without this minimal information,

56
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.900
no predictions can be made about

57
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.495
the dynamic objects
future states.

58
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.560
Finally, there are
many other pieces of information

59
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.290
which although not required
to make a prediction,

60
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.485
can greatly improve the accuracy
of the predictions.

61
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:47.560
While this list that we'll
present is not exhaustive,

62
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.870
it does demonstrate some
of the major sources of

63
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.110
additional information
to improve predictions.

64
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.000
First is the history of

65
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.500
the dynamic vehicle state or

66
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.290
the vehicle track as it moves
through the environment.

67
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.390
This can be extremely useful.

68
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.070
You've learned how to generate

69
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.245
vehicle tracks from object
detections in course three.

70
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:08.965
We can use this information
to get a better idea

71
00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:12.265
of how the object is maneuvering
through the environment.

72
00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:14.770
As we can see in our example,

73
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.750
we can see the vehicle
state history

74
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.520
shown as black arrow,

75
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.200
with the position heading and

76
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.525
speed represented as before.

77
00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.150
A high definition
roadmap can also be

78
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.760
used as an additional
information source,

79
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.940
to determine future behavior
of dynamic objects.

80
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.730
As will be discussed
further in this module,

81
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.260
vehicles tend to follow

82
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.510
their respective lanes while
driving down the road.

83
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.850
This can provide strong cues

84
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.280
to improve prediction accuracy.

85
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.650
An image of the dynamic object

86
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.270
in its current state can also

87
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.380
be a useful source of

88
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.050
information that can
improve predictions.

89
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.425
This is true for both vehicles
and pedestrians.

90
00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:56.230
For vehicles, the image
can provide information

91
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.105
concerning the current
indicator light

92
00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.505
or brake lights
states, for example.

93
00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.170
Similarly, images
of pedestrians can

94
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.025
serve to show the current
orientation of the person,

95
00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.720
which can help predict
a future direction of travel,

96
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.585
even if the pedestrian
is currently stationary.

97
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.850
Although the complexities of

98
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.730
the task of motion
prediction are quite large,

99
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.470
there are several
assumptions we can

100
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.960
use to simplify the problem.

101
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.020
We will start by looking
at simplifications for

102
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.945
vehicles and then move
on to pedestrians.

103
00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:29.660
These are the two main
categories we'll discuss,

104
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.150
but you can imagine
similar approaches needed for

105
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.640
cyclists and animals
such as dear,

106
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.860
rodents, or even kangaroos.

107
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.830
The first class of
assumptions we rely on,

108
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.080
is that vehicles
must follow a set of

109
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800
physical constraints
governing their movement.

110
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.790
As we saw in course
one when we were

111
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.025
discussing Vehicle
Kinematics and Dynamics.

112
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:53.375
These very same vehicle dynamics
can be applied to

113
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:55.130
other vehicles in the environment

114
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.125
to predict their motion.

115
00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.030
We refer to this type of

116
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.595
prediction as a
physics-based prediction.

117
00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:04.640
The second class of assumptions
that can be used are

118
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.460
that almost all motions
by a vehicle on the road,

119
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.200
are made up of a finite set of

120
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.530
maneuvers in a restricted domain
in the environment.

121
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.290
In this case, we assume
that vehicles which are on

122
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.640
the road will stay on the road

123
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.590
and follow the driving rules.

124
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.570
For example, they
will most likely

125
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.520
stay in their lane
unless indicating

126
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.050
otherwise and stop at

127
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.525
regulatory elements
requiring stops.

128
00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.280
They are unlikely to drive over

129
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.070
sidewalks or lawns or
through obstacles.

130
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.930
We refer to this type of
assumption as maneuver-based.

131
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.130
Finally, the third class makes

132
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.935
the same assumptions as
the maneuver-based assumptions.

133
00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:41.660
However, instead of only

134
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.180
evaluating each vehicle
independently,

135
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.000
we can also incorporate
the assumption that

136
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.440
the dynamic objects will

137
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.050
react and interact
with each other.

138
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.689
An example of this type
of prediction,

139
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.055
is during a merge by a vehicle
into an adjacent lane.

140
00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:58.490
Often, the vehicle in

141
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.100
the destination lane
will slow down to make

142
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.080
more room for
the incoming vehicle to

143
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.615
maintain a safe
following distance.

144
00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.730
These types of
assumptions are referred

145
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.855
to as interaction-aware
assumptions.

146
00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:13.940
For pedestrians,
the same three categories can be

147
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.700
used to summarize
the assumptions we can make.

148
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.250
In terms of physics-based
assumptions,

149
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.100
pedestrians tend to
have a low top speed

150
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.810
but can change their direction of

151
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.745
motion and speed very quickly.

152
00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:28.550
This makes pedestrians quite
challenging to predict

153
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.745
reliably using purely
physics-based assumptions,

154
00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.310
but the range of
positions a pedestrian

155
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.800
can reach in a short
time frame is limited.

156
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.955
For maneuver based assumptions,

157
00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:44.495
pedestrians tend not to interact
directly with vehicles.

158
00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:46.715
As they primarily
use sidewalks or

159
00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:50.030
other pedestrian exclusive
zones when traveling.

160
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.460
When entering
the drivable areas of

161
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.110
the environment such
that they might

162
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.940
come into contact with vehicles,

163
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.760
they primarily use
pedestrian crossings.

164
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.490
Although restricting
pedestrian motion to

165
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.099
these regions is
a reasonable assumption,

166
00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:06.095
it is not a hard constraint

167
00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:08.600
and the unpredictability
of pedestrians

168
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.900
requires maintaining
multiple possible hypotheses

169
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.260
about their future actions.

170
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.855
Finally, pedestrians ultimately
have the right of way

171
00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:19.670
and it is the
self-driving cars duty

172
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.080
to stop when necessary.

173
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.090
Inattentive
pedestrians may wander

174
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.859
into a roadway without warning,

175
00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:26.300
but will often stop when

176
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.385
threatened by
an oncoming vehicle.

177
00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.670
These types of interactive
assumptions can also be

178
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.195
incorporated into motion
prediction for pedestrians.

179
00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:37.414
Now that we have
a better understanding

180
00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:38.660
of motion prediction,

181
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.680
let's have a look at

182
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.710
a simple computationally
efficient algorithm,

183
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.150
that can be equally applied to

184
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.430
both pedestrians and vehicles.

185
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.760
This algorithm makes
only one extreme assumption

186
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.010
regarding the motion
of the dynamic object.

187
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.020
All dynamic objects will maintain

188
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.790
their current velocity both in

189
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.295
terms of magnitude
as well as heading.

190
00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.650
Understanding this,
let's now look at

191
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.600
the algorithmic implementation of

192
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.615
this simple constant
velocity model.

193
00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:09.680
The algorithm takes
three basic inputs t,

194
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.260
the prediction horizon or
the amount of time to predict

195
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.200
the object's location
into the future, dt,

196
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.480
the update rate or path
simulation frequency,

197
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.830
that is the amount of time
between state predictions,

198
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.550
and x object, the
current object's state

199
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.320
which includes the position and

200
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.990
velocity of the dynamic object.

201
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.680
This algorithm iterates
from the current time zero

202
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.920
until the end of the horizon t
in increments of dt.

203
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.500
As we saw in the trajectory
rollout algorithm

204
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.925
in the previous videos,

205
00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:45.050
updating the path with
constant velocity model.

206
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.200
The output of this algorithm is

207
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.390
a list of predicted
objects states,

208
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.400
positions, and velocities for

209
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.985
every time step in
the prediction horizon.

210
00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:57.480
To see how well
these predictions perform,

211
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.435
let's look at a quick example.

212
00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:01.850
We'll use a three
second horizon with

213
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.830
a one second update step and

214
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.105
the current vehicles state as

215
00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:07.930
indicated by the red arrow
in this figure.

216
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.730
As expected, the
predicted locations of

217
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.950
the vehicle move in
a constant direction with

218
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.900
a fixed step size which

219
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.885
corresponds very nicely with
this straight line segment,

220
00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:19.720
with a constant speed limit.

221
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.590
Simply put, this is because

222
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.315
the constant velocity assumption

223
00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:25.940
is valid for
this segment of roadway.

224
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.330
Where the constant
velocity estimate fails,

225
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.920
however, is everywhere else.

226
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.170
While this algorithm
weakly falls into

227
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.510
the category of
physics-based assumptions,

228
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.680
it fails to capture

229
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.410
the full complexity of
vehicle dynamics models,

230
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.170
or even the ability of
a vehicle to accelerate or

231
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.905
decelerate or apply a steering
command other than zero.

232
00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:49.730
Another large flaw of the
constant velocity assumption,

233
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.920
is that it fails to
account for vehicles

234
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.025
tendency to follow changes
in the road shape.

235
00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:58.160
At every point in
this curved roadway example,

236
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.110
the constant velocity
model predicts

237
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.065
the path will continue
into the oncoming lane.

238
00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:04.640
These predictions are wholly

239
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.715
unsuited to behavior planning.

240
00:10:06.715 --> 00:10:10.100
Similarly, the constant
velocity prediction fails to

241
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.325
account for road signs to
make velocity adjustments.

242
00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:15.590
Vehicles approaching
stop signs tend to slow

243
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.210
down and vehicles leaving
a stop line tend to accelerate.

244
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.290
The assumption which
this algorithm

245
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.120
makes is quite strong and does

246
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.010
not apply for most cases

247
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.155
that dynamic objects
may be observed in.

248
00:10:27.155 --> 00:10:29.960
The key challenge to motion
prediction is really

249
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.600
to select the most likely inputs,

250
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.470
to a vehicle or pedestrian model

251
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.235
given what information
is available.

252
00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:40.250
Nonetheless, the constant
velocity model is

253
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.470
an excellent starting
point and helps

254
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.470
define the concept of
motion prediction clearly.

255
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.210
It relies on a minimum of

256
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.220
information about
the dynamic object,

257
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.890
to form its predictions
and can be used

258
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.130
wherever additional cues
are completely unavailable.

259
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.070
Let's summarize. In this lesson,

260
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.500
we learned about the task
of motion prediction for

261
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.265
dynamic objects and its
importance to autonomous driving.

262
00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:06.425
We then defined minimal and

263
00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:09.185
optional information
requirements to create

264
00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:11.705
effective motion
prediction algorithms

265
00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:14.510
for both vehicles
and pedestrians.

266
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.190
We then looked at a simple

267
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.290
constant velocity algorithm
for predicting

268
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.450
the future location
of objects and

269
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.120
identified many of
its limitations.

270
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.010
In the next video,
we will look at

271
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.410
the methods to enhance
our motion predictions,

272
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.490
through the use of

273
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.010
high-definition roadmaps.
We'll see you then.
